But my thesis is that burgeoning cultures of print also carry a post-digital sensibility, where paper, pixel, and critique of media form open out into a complex field of publishing potential unconstrained by the depoliticized fixation of the technological “new.” Let me stress that in no sense do I aim to map this field, which is developing in numerous exciting directions that I have not addressed here. The contribution made by Anti-Book to the contemporary field of post-digital publishing is to introduce and extend specifically communist problematics as they pertain to the many materialities of text. Anti-Book carries a post-digital sensibility, then, with explorations of paper and print publishing taking a dominant place in many of the chapters that follow. (…) My point in approaching these with a post-digital eye is not to say that differences of media history and sociopolitical conjuncture are now collapsed by the post-digital condition, as if these works have been made wholly contemporary. Rather, their salience is as historical instances of experimental material text that indicate alternative trajectories through the largely text-bound history of political textual media. These trajectories in part become visible because of the perceptivities that are opened by digital media, which, as Derrida put it, might “liberate our reading for a retrospective exploration of the past resources of paper, for its previously multimedia vectors,” but this is only insofar as they are also grasped by contemporary problems in the politics of material text.","Each writing space is a material and visual field, whose properties are de­termined by a writing technology and the uses to which that technology is put by a culture of readers and writers. A writing space is generated by the interaction of material properties and cultural choices and practices. More­over, each space depends for its meaning on previous spaces or on contem­porary spaces against which it competes. Each fosters a particular understanding both of the act of writing and of the product, the written text, and this understanding expresses itself in writing styles, genres, and lit­erary theories. The writing space is also a space for reading, as Roger Chartier reminds us (Chartier, 1994, p. 2; 1995): communities of readers help to define the properties of the writing space by the demands they place on the text and the technology. For ancient Greece and Rome, the space for writing and reading was the inner surface of a continuous roll, which the writer divided into columns— not because papyrus had to be used this way, but because ancient culture made this choice. The space of the papyrus roll defined itself in relation to earlier oral forms of communication and to stone or wood inscriptions ( = > p. 77). For medieval handwriting and modern printing, the space was the white surface of the page, particularly in a bound volume, which was again a cultural decision of both the Latin and Byzantine Middle Ages. Initially, in late antiquity, the handwritten codex was in competition with the space of the papyrus roll and offered advan­tages that must have seemed important to contemporary readers. In the 15th century, the printed book defined itself in relation to the manuscript codex that it sought to displace. The space of electronic writing is both the computer screen, where text is displayed, and the electronic memory, in which text is stored. Our culture has chosen to fashion these technologies into a writing space that is animated, visually complex, and malleable in the hands of both writer and reader. In this late age of print, however, writers and readers still often conceive of text as located in the space of a printed book, and they conceive of the electronic writing space as a refashioning of the older space of print.","I do not mean to suggest that such interplay between print and digital media is an inherent good. In the face of the digital restructuring of textual media, Derrida seems to take comfort from the living on of the book (where “we can trust in the conservative, even fetishistic impulse” to “sanctify—sanctify once again—the book, the aura of culture or cult of the book”), whereas an anti-book orientation would be more critical, for which Johanna Drucker’s research is instructive. By contrast to Bolter’s notion that digital hypertext is the realization of the aesthetic promise of experimental print, Drucker argues compellingly that the aesthetic potential of digital text has in fact been hidebound to the clichéd and reductive iconography of the book that abounds in culture, with “too much emphasis on formal replication of layout, graphic, and physical features and too little analysis of how those features affect the book’s function.” It results in aesthetic forms and design applications that are often less complex and dynamic than the three-dimensional object of the codex, the branching structure of hypertext contrasting less than favorably to the “n-dimensional” reading of the printed page, as Jerome McGann has described the “multivariate” potential of the page for multiple, layered, and discontinuous meanings and semiotic interactions. Drucker calls instead for a “diagrammatic writing” of new textual mediums and semantic effects that is truly responsive to the spatial and graphic potential of fungible electronic environments, a move that would break the conservative hold of book iconology on digital media while allowing books to continue their work of experimentation, apart and, no doubt, in interplay with digital diagrammatic writing. Again, we see here the post-digital difference and interplay of mediums in their specificity, which Drucker embodies in her own practice as researcher and practitioner in both the digital realms of speculative computing and printed artists’ books. Other compelling experiments in this post-digital terrain include work on “hybrid publishing” and the “unbound book” at centers like Leuphana University’s Hybrid Publishing Lab, Amsterdam’s Institute of Network Cultures, and Coventry University’s Centre for Disruptive Media, where the unbound book, as Gary Hall describes it, develops “the book as something that is not fixed, stable and unified, with definite limits and clear material edges, but as liquid and living, open to being continually and collaboratively written, edited, annotated, critiqued, updated, shared, supplemented, revised, reordered, reiterated and reimagined.” I should mention also the astonishing resource of experimental post-digital publishing curated by Silvio Lorusso, the Post-Digital Publishing Archive."]},{"Topic":0,"Count":31,"Name":"0_media_new_techniques_metamedium","Representation":["media","new","techniques","metamedium","computer metamedium"],"Representative_Docs":["This, in my view, is the key mechanism responsible for the evolution and expansion of the computer metamedium from the late 1980s until now—and I do not see any reason why this mechanism would become less important in the future. And while at the time when Kay and Goldberg were writing their article the process of hybridization was just barely starting—(…)—today it is what media design is all about. Thus, from the point of view of today, the computer metamedium is indeed an umbrella for many things—but rather than only containing a set of separate mediums, it also contains a larger set of smaller building blocks that unite to create hybrids. These building blocks include algorithms for media creation and editing, data formats, interface metaphors, navigation techniques, physical interaction techniques, web technologies, and other element types. Over time, new elements are being invented and they also become parts of the computer metamedium. Periodically people figure out new ways in which some of the elements available can work together, producing new species. Some of these species may survive. Some may become new conventions, so omnipresent that they are not perceived anymore as combinations of elements which can be taken apart. Still others are forgotten—only to be sometimes reinvented later.","(…) following the first stage where most already existing media were simulated in software and a number of new computer techniques for generating and editing of media were invented—the stage that conceptually and practically has been largely completed by the late 1970s—we entered a new period governed by hybridization. The already simulated mediums started exchanging properties and techniques. As a result, the computer metamedium came to contain endless new species. In parallel, we do indeed see a continuous process of the invention of the new—but what are being invented are not whole new media types but rather new elements (new techniques for creating, modifying and sharing media data). As soon as they are invented, these new elements start to interact with other, already existing elements. Thus, the processes of invention and hybridization are closely linked and work together.","Certainly, it is possible to conceive of multimedia as a particular case of hybrid media. However, I prefer to think of them as overlapping but ultimately two different developments. While some classical multimedia applications of the 1990s would qualify as media hybrids, most will not. Conversely, although media hybrids often feature content in different media, this is only one aspect of their make-up. So what is the difference between the two? In multimedia documents and interactive applications, content types in multiple media appear next to each other. In a web page, images and video appear next to text; a blog post may similarly show text, followed by images and more text; a 3D world may contain a flat screen object used to display video. Alternatively, each element of a multimedia message opens in its own viewer (this was the case for MMS implementations in the phones of the 2000s). In contrast, in media hybrids, interfaces, techniques, and ultimately the most fundamental assumptions of different media forms and traditions, are brought together resulting in new media gestalts. That is, they merge together to offer a coherent new experience different from experiencing all the elements separately."]},{"Topic":1,"Count":16,"Name":"1_marinetti_italian_palazzeschi_paid","Representation":["marinetti","italian","palazzeschi","paid","di"],"Representative_Docs":["Aron Hector Schmitz, writing as Italo Svevo, published his first two novels at his own expense, Una vita (Vram Editore, 1886) and Sentilita (Libreria Ettore, 1898). Both books went completely ignored by critics and readers alike, and Svevo abandoned literature. A few years later, he befriended James Joyce during the Irishman’s so-called ‘Ttalian exile’ (Svevo's wife, Livia Veneziani, is immortalized in Finnegans Wake as Anna Livia Plurabelle). After reading Senilita, Joyce encouraged Svevo to return to writing and in 1923 La coscienza di Zeno reached bookstores, again at the author's own expense. Despite others’ indifference, Joyce promoted the book, and after its translation into French its popularity began to grow. Zeno is now regarded as one of the greatest Italian novels of the twentieth century.","When Futurism exploded in 1909, Aldo Palazzeschi (pseudonym of Aldo Giurlani) had already published three books at his own expense: two volumes of poetry, I cavalli bianchi (1905) and Lanterna (1907), and a novel, Riflessi (1908). On the cover of the latter two books the publisher is listed as Cesare Blanc, and Palazzechi’s fourth book, Poemi (1909), was said to have been both printed and edited by Blanc. Blane turned out to be Palazzeschi’s cat. Impressed by Poemi, F. T. Marinetti agreed to publish Palazzeschi’s following work, L’incendiario in the series Edizioni Futuriste di Poesia, but once again, Palazzeschi would have to pay (750 lire to print 1,000 copies, although Marinetti obligingly offered to cover the distribution expenses). The book was hailed as one of the century's most brilliant collections. By 1914, Palazzeschi had abandoned Marinetti and the Futurists on account of ideological differences, going on to have a long and illustrious literary career. But he never forgot his faithful feline supporter.","The first art movement to attempt this transformation was Italian Futurism, with its hostility towards the perceived mawkishness of Romanticism, and its own eagerness to force a radical break with the past. The Futurists’ bold, iconoclastic statements (to which they owed much of their original fame and cultural impact) were distributed through various channels, including of course printed media. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti was in fact quite fond of print, particularly magazines. In 1905 he was editor in chief of Poesia, the international journal of the Futurist movement, produced with the support of a sympathetic printer – until Marinetti cancelled the project a few years later and went on to collaborate with the Florentine editor Giovanni Papini (who also worked closely with other Futurists). The resulting Lacerba magazine, printed in 1914, featured a re-thinking of typo-graphical composition, beginning a process (with Marinetti’s famous work Parole in Libertà) of pushing to the very limit the possibilities of black-and-white letterpress printing. The use of markedly contrasting font sizes, as well as a creatively graphical positioning of text elements (diagonally, forming visual patterns, etc) all helped to produce a new kind of typography, which aimed to express not only a rich variety of visual forms but also powerful emotions."]},{"Topic":2,"Count":20,"Name":"2_samizdat_self_artists_self publishing","Representation":["samizdat","self","artists","self publishing","underground"],"Representative_Docs":["Originally started as a way to compensate for the book shortage generated by preventive censorship and to circulate texts, which for various reasons were quite unlikely to be printed in the state-controlled media, samizdat soon developed into the privileged medium of political dissent and, as such, it was incorporated into Cold War narratives. (…) Yet, from a chronologically distant perspective, samizdat emerges, ﬁrst of all, as a medium which challenges to a great extent our presuppositions about how a published text should look like. Namely, while it established a parallel level of textual production, samizdat recalled to life aspects of scribal culture which have been marginalized by the invention of the printing press. On the one hand, underground self-publishers questioned the state monopoly on print; on the other one their activity signiﬁcantly impacted on ﬁrmly established concepts of authorship and reception. “Writers write a text, readers read it […]. This tradition, which dates back to the nineteenth century—a relatively peaceful time, favorable to literary creation—has been now interrupted”, Andrey Sinyavskiy explained in 1977, while participating in a conference on literature and political dissent, organized as a collateral event of the Venice Biennale. The émigré writer (who in February 1966 had been sentenced to a seven-year prison term for having published his works abroad) had in mind the overlapping of the author’s, reader's, and publisher’s function, which often occurred in samizdat practice. Thus, by reproducing a text by typing (and/or photocopying, taking photos of) it, the samizdat “readers / scribes” exceeded the responsibilities traditionally ascribed to the recipient of a literary work, in so far as they established a new edition of the text, designed the external layout of the book, and became engaged in its further dissemination.","How do all these elements come into the picture if we turn our attention to samizdat artists’ publications? To hat extend were artist’ publications issued int he context of Soviet self-publishing affected by the medial specificities of samizdat production that we have tried to describe? To what degree did they respond to the widespread appraisal of the book as the most appropriate medium for disseminating artistic ideas—considering that many Soviet artists who engaged self-publishing as an artistic practice were inspired by new trend coming from the West? As the exhibition “Russian samizdat art,” curated by Rimma Gerlovina and Valeriy Gerlovin at Franklin Furnace in New York in 1982 made clear, self-publishing (obviously in its own “authorial” version), during Brezhnev’s “stagnation,” had represented an invaluable tool for visual artists to experiment with the “bookwork” form and document their own creative practice in a free, uncensored way. Yet, one should not forget that the boundaries between the two attitudes—creating and archiving—were extremely permeable. On the one hand, the ever increasing institutionalization of self-publishing in the 1970s led to a strong tendency toward critical self-reflection and deconstruction. As Sabine Hänsgen and Georg With remarked, in several samizdat bookworks, the object of desacralization was not necessarily the typographical book, issued by the State, but rather the samizdat typewritten copy itself, if not, I would add, the whole “reading scene” connected to self-publishing.","In this respect, it is remarkable that, while underground artists turned to samizdat to document their works, they also began to explore it as a medium in its own right, creating artworks expressly for typewritten editions. This twofold approach toward self-publishing is well reflected by the Moscow typewritten art magazine Metki novoy zhivopisi (Marking the new painting), edited by Vladimir Petrov and Vitaly Gibkov between 1975 and 1979. Beside publishing theoretical contributions on unofficial art, the editors turned their journal into a collective platform for ephemeral, hic et nun experiments, by “yielding the floor” to visual artists and asking them to conceive the new issue as a whole. This happened on two different occasions, namely in 1979, as the young members of the group Mukhomory (Toadstools) re-designed Metki #8 in the spirit of the provocative, colorful aesthetics which characterized their handwritten books. Three years earlier, on March 3rd, 1976, Andrey Monastyrskiy, Nikita Alekseyev, and Lev Rubishteyn—who where about to conceive Poyavlenie (Appearance), the first “action” of the Kollektivnye deystviya (Collective Actions) group— had transformed the editing of Metki #3 in a one-day performance: instead of publishing the expected documentation related to their artworks, they preferred to turn the journal into a conceptual piece, by providing a brief linguistic description of their minimalistic interventions on it, accompanied by the precise timing of when they took place. (…) Whereas the Metki issues released by artists exemplify the strong performative character samizdat bookworms were generally invested with, some other underground artists’ publications were generally invested with, some other underground artists’ publications were rather centered on the blurring borders between creating and documenting, performing and archiving. This is the case of the probably most ambitious self-publishing project initiated by Moscow underground artists: I refer to four MANI Files (Moscow Archive of New Art) edited between February 1981 and 1982 in ﬁve copies and distributed to a few colleagues and friends. Each folder contained up to forty-four envelopes, each of them devoted to one participant. Artists were requested to insert some pictures or texts in their personal envelopes in order to present their activity, thus to make it public—although in a very narrow circle. This elementary, open-ended schema inspired a large range of solutions, reﬂecting different ideas about how the self-published archive should look like. (…) Nevertheless, all the aforementioned artists conceived the MANI archive as, basically, a self-made substitute for a typographic catalog.

The campaign involved printing and distributing several thousand copies of a fake New York Times Special Edition set in the near future (July 4, 2009) and featuring only positive news, perhaps briefly plausible after Barack Obama’s election as U.S. President. The fake special edition copied the ‘look and feel’ of the real New York Times in painstaking detail (including the usual advertisements), and succeeded in fooling a significant portion of the general public who picked up a copy early in the morning (a large network of volunteers, organised through the Internet, distributed the publication on the streets, all apparently without any legal repercussions). The fact that a newspaper, the most visibly endangered of all contemporary media, was the chosen medium for this campaign demonstrates on one hand the ongoing trust of the public in printed media such as newspapers (as well as our endless appetite for news); on the other hand, the same printed media are also clearly in a process of profound mutation, which is causing a major shift in their relationship with the public. The need to be kept up-to-date, previously catered to by the morning newspapers, is now being serviced through the Web and the even more addictive RSS web feeds, constantly updated from hundreds of sources. And consequently the ‘unified’ but ever-changing newspaper increasingly aims to fulfil our need to know ‘what will happen now’, by attempting to announce rather than narrate reality, while continuing to sell the feeling of being part of a community.","Of course, the presence of non-stop, omnipresent news does not mean that all news is equal.

In synopsis, I propose that publishing is a set of historical processes and practices—composition, editing, design and illustration, production, marketing and promotion, and distribution—and a set of relations with various other institutions—commercial, legal, educational, political, cultural, and, perhaps, above all, other media. Publishing as a set of processes and relations forms a sequence or range of what I term horizons of the publishable, which govern what it is thinkable to publish within a particular historical moment. Publishing, far from being the mediating term between writing and reading, writer and reader, precedes and constitutes all formations of writing and reading. The publishable governs what is writeable and what is readable. There is no field of publishing—literary fiction publishing, for instance—or reading practice that is exempt from this. The horizon of the publishable is not the utilitarian counter to romantic or post-romantic formulations of the creative process. It is not the logic of the industry orienting the writer's work for the market. Writing is not opposed to publishing: composition is one of its processes. It has its own specificity but it is not of a different order. Barthes approvingly cites Mallarme, \\"wanting the audience to produce the book,\\" but books are not merely written: composition is only one process.' The book is no longer imagined as boundary and stasis that seeks to constrain the ever-multiplying volume and movement of language, but as a site where various publishing processes—writing, editing, design, marketing, production—intersect and conflict.","The classic as described above is a publishing category and the publishable is importantly category-specific. One of the weaknesses in general accounts of the book and textual editing is a neglect of publishing categories (and how these may intersect with genres understood in more conventional literary-critical senses). Perhaps some clarification is required here. There are certainly many individual studies of genres and some of publishing categories that take full account of publication. But this interest in the mediatic or discursive coordinates of particular genres is not grasped as a potential for thinking the publishing category in its most general terms. Adams and Barker censure Darnton for his focus on people (the publisher, the shipper, the bookseller) rather than the book and its life cycle. My response to Adams and Barker is that there is no book as such, only types or categories of book—even at the highest levels of abstraction. The publishable and its horizons, as I define them, are embedded in this understanding of the book as always being an instance of a type or category. All types of book—whether eighteenth-century English maritime books, early-nineteenth-century reading primers, gender-segregating late-Victorian children's fiction, contemporary city guides for tourists, or art exhibition catalogues—are most productively understood as a distinctive set of relations between publishing practices and other institutions and processes. In each of the examples above, for instance, the production, reproduction, and positioning of illustrations and images within the body text are central and, in some instances, the dominant process. These maps, plans, alphabets, and sound sequences, as well as numerous illustrative and photographic genres (including photographs of other images), shape the publishing category or genre in question, including its mode of reading. The tables of sound patterns in many early-nineteenth-century German reading primers clearly inscribe a spoken context, which assigns the roles of teacher (mother) and pupil (child) very explicitly in pedagogic patterns of progression and repetition. One of the important effects of illustration in late-nineteenth-century children's fiction is to enforce gender divisions in ways that names and pronouns cannot. The preponderance of images of the hero or heroine must surely make cross-gender identifications between character and reader more difficult. More generally, illustrated books of all kinds are far more sensitive to changes in the technologies of book production than non-illustrated ones, though these technologies are often not specific to the production of books (photography, digitization). The rise of collectibles, from Harry Potter paraphernalia to deluxe limited-edition Penguin Classics (seemingly in clear breach of the brand's original and long-advertised aims), is perhaps best understood as a particular conjunction of marketing and distribution. It is hard to imagine such editions being conceived outside the context of contemporary online resale, which has transformed the specialist, semi-private regimes of collection (and decisively blurred the distinction between used and collectible). This pattern and set of possibilities of redistribution is central to the constitution of the category in this case. While Allen Lane famously sought to transform book-borrowers into book-buyers by conjoining affordability with availability, websites like Amazon and Abe Books transform book-buyers into potential sellers or re-sellers. The category allows us to understand the specificity of a particular type of publishing, its relations to other media and institutions, and its relations to other categories.","Publishing then is a set of intersecting processes. The plural is crucial. Definitions of publishing as publication, gatekeeping, or commerce naturally tend to construe it as a singular process. In a very different way, critical editing of the traditional, poststructuralist and new historicist varieties tends to think of textual production exclusively as a conjunction of composition and editing—though the terms and character of this relation vary. The new textual studies' critique of the old inevitably centers on editorial practice, and questions about other practices and their relations are, in the main, subordinated to editing. Jerome McGann's formulation of the \\"editorial horizon\\" stands as a model both for what the new critical editing can achieve and its limits. McGann rightly insists on the always-already social and historical character of textual production, even that which appears private. In doing so, he transforms our ideas of critical editing, foregrounding its role in defining the fields of scholarship it intervenes in, and their underwriting concepts. But why is this horizon editorial? Editing seems to become a metonymy for the whole work of publishing. The editorial horizon is glossed in parenthesis as \\"(the horizon of [the text's] production and reproduction).\\" But editing and composition are only two of the processes of publishing. In the production of contemporary literary fiction and in the publishing of canonical literary works, composition and editing are indeed privileged processes, but can the specificity of the literary really be grasped without a set of contrasts with other publishing categories and practices, without a concept of publishing processes and institutions in more general terms: horizons of the publishable? The continued privileging of literature, implicit and explicit, in contemporary critical editing theory and practice (though this is clearly not the case in book history as a whole), inevitably simplifies the oppositions and others that the literary/non-literary binary creates. Critical editing is well aware of its value, but critical editing (in all its guises) only contributes one type of value to publishing as a whole. Every publishing category contributes value of some kind, even if there is still rather little attention given to the diverse ways in which cultural production accords value of diverse kinds to its objects. A thriller may be constituted as perfectly meeting the expectations of a genre or an author, a reliable page-turner and so on. These kinds of value, however modest, or routinely purpose-bound, can be constituted through a range of publishing practices, which in turn propose reading practices."]},{"Topic":7,"Count":23,"Name":"7_language_words_representations_provisional","Representation":["language","words","representations","provisional","representation"],"Representative_Docs":["I’m calling this change perverse because it flips the modification performed by the prefix im-, and so formulates a productive paradox: Now the im- in immediacy can be read as signifying a ‘movement toward’ the quality of being mediate, rather than signifying a ‘lack of mediality’ or a being ‘not mediated’. That second, negative sense of the prefix im- has until now modified the meaning of immediacy to signify an experience of direct contact between an I and another thing-in-itself, a contact that is direct because there’s nothing in between them. I’m not claiming that this definition is now somehow wrong – that now, when people have sex, it’s necessarily less immediate than it was, say, one hundred years ago – only that this definition is too simple if we’re going to try to analyse our experiences of writing and reading in our mediatised age. If language-in-itself is a constructed representation then any immediate contact with language must be directly with a representation plus the schema(s) it’s situated in. Representations can’t be themselves without a context because the (albeit real) present-ness of a representation is insufficient-in-itself by definition. Contemporary public language has productively extended this insufficiency by converting it into a hyper-situated-ness, linking links to links – always elsewhere, always more, always multi-directional.","Without some such faith that language has a natural state, status and presence, it’s difficult to think of writing as anything other than a representation of a non-presence, or rather, a present representation, as many high modernists believed. The idea that any language is anything other than the collective history and practice of that language being enacted – its materialisations – plus the temporality of those representations as material – material that only has a ‘being’ insofar as it gets engaged with – dissolves, like a faith unravelled, with the demystification of the idea that our languages could’ve ever been anything other than made and re-made by societies. Written language isn’t ‘something else’, something other than what we make it, something with an innate constitution. Language acts are representations of a schema of representations, they’re representations of representations, and all representations try to re-present something that they’re not. Language is the thing in between, in the middle, the medium; but it’s also always socially constructed and the mediator of anything made public in or with (within) it. The 140-character limit on Twitter doesn’t only constrain Tweets; it has echoing effects on attention spans, contractions of spelling and punctuation, and the skills expected of marketeers. It’s not that words no longer represent concepts, as the bandying of Marshal McLuhan’s famous ‘the medium is the message’ can mislead people to think, but that we have to recognise the increasing significative power of all the re-mediating processes and institutions that intersect to make any language act public.","The forms of languages, their ranges, their userships, and the demographic variety within each language’s usership, all only add to the historical baggage that inevitably builds up as a language gets older. When lexicographers add webspeak terms to the OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY news broadcasters react with chatter about how language is changing. But to do so by looking at the lexicon is to miss the more dramatically new change, which is fundamentally one of materiality – it’s a change in what language is (as a multiply-situated, impermanent and insufficient re-re-re-...representation) not necessarily what it’s used to say. Contemporary public language is clonable and fluid, overlaid and reproducible on-demand; it’s polymorphic and regulated by vectors, relayed from spinning magnetic discs elsewhere and as unstable as the media that has mediatised our ways and means of writing within it. Now it’s easy to feel like the language act is more immediate and dynamic than the supposed authorial subject behind that act. Now, more than ever, public language seems less and less like an expression of some already-public subject and more and more like that subject’s post-human proxy, my all-too-real avatar. Administering a popular Twitter account, for example, can make that authorial subject’s other contributions to public life seem inadequate. Mediatisation leads to our artificial subjectivity becoming more real (or more really dynamic) than any other aspect of our self-subject-hood. It’s as if via our artificial artificial subjectivity we can become more immediate and immediately engaged with the contemporary ‘real’ world than any pre-, un- or less-medial subject-position could possibly allow."]},{"Topic":8,"Count":68,"Name":"8_human_generated_computer_nlg","Representation":["human","generated","computer","nlg","computer generated"],"Representative_Docs":["Thirty years after the publication of La machine, the French-speaking world was still pondering similar questions about authorship attribution for computer-generated texts. The published proceedings of a conference about Literature and Computing: Computer-Generated Literature continues the investigation into authorial attribution of computer-generated texts; Baudot himself contributes a preface to the proceedings. In his manifesto for computer literature featured in these proceedings, Jean-Pierre Balpe distinguishes the author of the computer-generated texts as the programmer – and at times also the user – whose vision is manifest. Balpe writes: \\r\\nTaking abstract decisions, the ‘computer’ author is a text engineer who can only measure the functioning of his work once the entire machine is built. What he gives to read is both a text and his instructions. As with any technique, the use of the computer always tends to allow the autonomy of the user: the reading of the computer text invites the integration of the user manual, making the reader the editor of the literary creation.\\r\\nFor Balpe, the computer-generated text reflects human agency, serving as an extension of the human self rather than demonstrating computational creativity or autonomy.","Computer-generated texts are produced by natural language generation (NLG) systems. NLG is the process wherein computers use artificial intelligence (AI) to produce output in everyday human languages (e.g. English, French). NLG systems produce myriad kinds of texts, including data-driven reports, prose fiction, and poetry. This article begins with an introduction to computer-generated texts, reviewing some of the many forms these texts currently take. Before moving to its core discussion of authorship in computer-generated texts, this article clarifies how ‘authorship’ is interpreted herein. In the core discussion, literary, legal, and theoretical aspects of authorship in computer-generated texts are considered, as are some of the ways that authorship may be attributed to NLG system output. A discussion of the relevant literature follows, providing an overview of the state of research in the field and leading to some current research questions to address an absence of humanities scholarship in NLG studies.","(…) Jason Puskar notes that “[o]ne great irony of authorship is that people may scribble away as long as they like, but they remain writers, not authors, until institutions like publishers and book stores legitimize their work, and in the process, transform the nature of their own authority.” 86 Working from this understanding of authorship being constituted by a network, it is useful to consider a semantic shift from NLG systems as tools for manifesting human vision to NLG systems as agents in themselves. This shift is rooted in an appeal for deeper consideration of the transformative social effects of computer-generated texts. Recognising NLG systems as agents indicates appreciation of the unique labour economies emerging from and around this technology, as well as the unique contributions of systems to literature and other genres of text. (…) Rather, it is to say that the texts produced by NLG systems necessitate alternative approaches to interpretation than those written by humans. Moreover as NLG systems become increasingly pervasive, they may begin producing genres of text distinct from those established by human writers. To recognise NLG systems as agents is to allow for the development of such genres and to prevent the tendency towards evaluating computer-generated texts only in light of expectations held for human writers. It is to recognise NLG systems as authors: algorithmic authors operating according to unique circumstances and expectations. Recognising an NLG system as a social agent does not automatically make that system morally, financially, or legally responsible for its output, but it does serve as a starting point for recognising the unique contributions NLG systems make to the textual landscape."]},{"Topic":9,"Count":32,"Name":"9_writing_poetry_cut_literature","Representation":["writing","poetry","cut","literature","goldsmith"],"Representative_Docs":["In his book Uncreative Writing, Kenneth Goldsmith quotes Brion Gysin’s famous statement that literature was “fifty years behind painting”. Kenneth Goldsmith, Uncreative Writing, Columbia University Press 2011, 11. 11Nowadays, one would say that it is fifty years behind the visual arts. Goldsmith’s notion of uncreative, anti-expressive and conceptual writing rests on this hypothesis. Gysin referred, in the late 1950s, to the collage and montage techniques of Dada and surrealism that were the forerunners of his and William S. Burroughs’ cut-up texts. Goldsmith writes from the perspective of a creative writing professor who rebels against the unbroken romantic subjectivism in contemporary poetry and psychological realism in prose writing. In that sense, most literature is now running 100 years behind the visual arts while e-literature - just like sound poetry and visual poetry - keeps up rather well.","The method is simple. Here is one way to do it. Take a page. Like this page. Now cut down the middle and cross the middle. You have four sections: 1 2 3 4 . . . one two three four. Now rearrange the sections placing section four with section one and section two with section three. And you have a new page. Sometimes it says much the same thing. Sometimes something quite different—cutting up political speeches is an interesting exercise—in any case you will find that it says something and something quite definite.

Now take the poem and type out selected passages. Fill a page with excerpts. Now cut the page. You have a new poem. As many poems as you like. As many Shakespeare Rimbaud poems as you like. Tristan Tzara said: “Poetry is for everyone.” And André Breton called him a cop and expelled him from the movement.

What forms of literature are being written at the extremes of our contemporary real that weren’t previously possible? Automated writing services that compose new texts using a method called narrative analytics are a kind of limit-less limit case. For example, the Long Tail algorithm has been used to write over 890,000 new books, which have been published by Icon Group International since 1999. So-called narrative analytics programmes not only analyse a dataset for you but also narrate that analysis and produce new findings. Until now the latter at least – the production of new insights – which is to say, scientistically, the production of new knowledge – had been assumed to be the preserve of human authorial subjects. I can’t imagine a properly contemporary poetry, in the complicated double sense of contemporaneity that we’re now working with, that doesn’t explore the modes of writing or questions raised by these kinds of technical and non-literary developments. They cast a technical foreshadow in front of (before) all new writing. Poets who promblematise the shade of this foreshadow, like those amongst the Conceptual Writing scene, do so by taking the risk of producing improperly extra-literary acts that often can’t or aren’t seen to be poetic. They hyper-extend the new status_anxieties of poetic voice and the seemingly infinite ambience of its formations. The production and circulation of such work approaches the fact that there’s never been so much public language and yet public language has never been so insufficient, and tries to turn that fact into a conceptually productive (and shared) problematic. The (im)mediacy of much such work manages to quickly capture, then just as quickly lose, the interest of lots of poetry readers. Given that the prefix im- is a variant spelling of in-, we might better bend English grammar to describe the (im)mediate public language acts as inmediate. I suggest so not least because the artificial artificial subjectivities that we re-re-re-...produce through inmediate public language acts seem to make the mediatisation of writing starkly legible where it might otherwise remain invisible and culturally unread."]},{"Topic":10,"Count":31,"Name":"10_books_title_author_book","Representation":["books","title","author","book","written"],"Representative_Docs":["Bénabou's vertigo is as nothing compared to the limitless library envisaged by Jacques Jouet, the potential library that would unofﬁcially constitute the different kinds of imaginary books set within real books. More than the old game of story-within—a—story, this would involve books imagined at the very heart of a ﬁction, functioning as a motif. The author could indeed, at some point in his story, have need of a book. For this, he has two choices: the ﬁrst is to use a real book, written by an actual author, published, and therefore palpable. The reading list of Madame Bovary is of this type, as are those of Proust’s narrator, or the books in the library of Alfred Iarry’s Dr. Faustroll. In this way, the Paul and Virginia read by Emma, the François le Champi discovered at the Guermantes’, or The Songs of Maldoror on the shelves of Dr. Faustroll’s library are, without a doubt, identical to those that we have read, or could read. Therefore, in the same way that an author can develop his or her characters in real places, which the reader can then physically visit, actual titles can occur in a story because a character came across them, obtained them, read them, or wrote them. Actually, to choose one’s reading according to the hero of a story would be a lovely project.","Because the true text is precisely what constitutes the work I have been searching for: not the words actually reported or retold, but all the words the author might have made the old woman say, and the entire Wedding built around them; it would also include the completed book by Antoine Roquentin, as well as The Crypt, liberated by another person's reading. These works are lost for the simple reason that they are incomplete. These books that I have not written will have to remain so. It does not mean, through the pretext of a synopsis or an author’s note of intention, developing a text whose precise form can never be known. Nor is it exactly writing in the style of another author, of mimicking the tics of their language, or of hijacking their turns of phrase. Neither is it to extend an unﬁnished work, or to put forward variations. It means ﬁnding, according to the growing degrees of existence of the imaginary book, from vague allusion to quotes, passing via the detailed outline, the cases of autonomous books which contain enough information to be written and therefore published in an independent volume. Such books have not only a title and an author, but the entirety of their content is available, quoted at length in the body of the text, requiring just a simple copying, or involving certain literary fictions invented by a real author. This is where the possibility of editorial work to dig out these books from within other books begins, and whose reality, up to now subordinated, only depends on being put down on the page. The publisher which brings these together is called Lorem Ipsum. It takes its name from the dummy text used by printers, randomly generated as placeholder for a missing text, to aid layout and calibration of the proofs. In the same way, the publications of Lorem Ipsum are potential books which already exist, captured with all the ease of cut-and—paste. The difficulty lies in unearthing these rare cases.","Talking about his own oeuvre, Cervantes said that one should also admire him for what he had not written. This statement contains in itself the whole idea of a counter—literature, a blank or hollow literature, stolen from our hands and our sight for the simple reason that it was never written. Faced with the thousands of volumes lined up to inﬁnity on the library shelves, a work is also everything that was not, or could not be written down on paper: its failures, its hesitations, its regrets, its projects, its fantasies, its ideal even, ﬁlling far more than pages, but entire lives. There are books, then, that we must be content with imagining: Le Traité du dandysme (On Dandyism) promised by Charles Baudelaire, the six Célestes (Luminaries), corresponding to the six Diaboliques (The She Devils) by Barbey d’Aurevilly, or again the novel Vita Nova by Roland Barthes of which we know only the ﬁrst eight pages; and there are authors with the special status as writers of unwritten books: Jacques Rigaut, a member of the Dada movement whose Papiers posthumes (Posthumous Papers), for better or worse, form a volume, remained paralyzed when faced with the creative act. The same fate awaited Jacques Vaché’s oeuvre — that is, his correspondence with ﬁgures like Andre Breton — which contained in its few lines, the foundations of surrealism. As for Ioseph Ioubert, he left a few articles, some letters, and a total devotion to literature. He dreamed his entire  life of his book, which he prepared and began ceaselessly, pouring into his copious notes an ideal he could only long for. He only encountered literature on its peripheries, ﬁrst as the reader of others, as he was a great admirer of Denis Diderot and Restif de la Bretonne, as well as being a habitué of writers’ circles, then as the reader of his own. unattainable works, which he always seemed to hold at arm's length. Except you must actually begin, as Henry James tried to convince himself: “[B]egin it — begin it! Don’t talk about it only, and around it.” But all through his book, Marcel Bénabou never ﬁnishes beginning, to the point where — an irony of sorts — a book appears. So, the reason why he never wrote any of his books, at least as he could have imagined them, has nothing to do with pseudonyms, or with plagiarism, but with the vertigo caused by all the books already written and the premonition of those to come in the flux of an “ever ongoing production” The paralysis is partly due to quantity: “Perhaps you are among those who, like me, can no longer go to a bookstore without feeling a twinge of sorrow, but who don't leave without feeling a certain uneasiness either, indeed a sort of virtual nausea: so many books.\\" And, partly due to quality. in that we all could have been the objects of our own jealousy if only we could have been bothered: “Will I dare bring up in passing the feeling of frustration that certain books left in me? Not because they disappointed me; quite the contrary. But I couldn’t keep myself from thinking as I read that once again I had missed an opportunity.

Decentered text — a text that is skewed from the direct line of communication from sender to receiver, severed from the authority of its origin, a free — floating element in a field of possible significations — figures heavily in constructions of a design based in reading and readers. But Katherine McCoy’s prescient image of designers moving beyond problem solving and by “authoring additional content and a self-conscious critique of the message, adopting roles associated with art and literature,” is often misconstrued. Rather than working to incorporate theory into their methods of production, many selfproclaimed deconstructivist designers literally illustrated Barthes’ image of a reader-based text — a “tissue of quotations drawn from innumerable centers of culture” — by scattering fragments of quotations across the surface of their “authored” posters and book covers. (This technique went something like: “Theory is complicated, so my design is complicated.”) The rather dark implications of Barthes’ theory, note Ellen Lupton and J. Abbott Miller, were refashioned into a “romantic theory of self-expression.”","In his ‘What is an Author?’ essay, Michel Foucault explores the ways in which authorship is a cultural construct, a discursive function greater than any one individual; he favours ‘author function’ over ‘author’. For Foucault, the judicial system enforcing ownership rights has played a vital role in establishing the author function as it is now known. Foucault explains that the system emerged as a means for combatting religious and social transgression, holding writers accountable for their words. In this view, authorial attribution was developed to maintain order within the larger collective society. Hence while modern reading practices are often regarded as solitary and individualistic, emphasising the subjectivity of each reader, they are nevertheless informed by social institutions related to intellectual property. A discussion of authorship benefits from the legal documentation about copyright because copyright represents systemic judicial practices rooted in social custom and values. Recognising the evolution of copyright thereby permits a more pointed discussion of historical and modern conceptions of authorship, as well as ways in which NLG may conform to or confront these conceptions. Legal documents also offer somewhat stable and traceable definitions of authorship that have remained in flux so long as authors have existed.","All literary theory, from Aristotle on, has in some form or another been theory of authorship. Since this is not a history of the author but a consideration of the author as metaphor, I’ll start with recent history. Wimsatt and Beardsley’s, seminal text, “The Intentional Fallacy” (1946), drove an early wedge between the author and the text, dispelling the notion that a reader could ever really know an author through his writing. The so-called death of the author, proposed most succinctly by Roland Barthes in 1968 in an essay of that title, is closely linked to the birth of critical theory, especially theory based in reader response and interpretation rather than intentionality. Michel Foucault used the rhetorical question “What is an author?” as the title of his influential essay of 1969 which, in response to Barthes, outlines the basic taxonomy and functions of the author and the problems associated with conventional ideas of authorship and origination."]},{"Topic":12,"Count":29,"Name":"12_designer_design_designers_director","Representation":["designer","design","designers","director","authorship"],"Representative_Docs":["The reaction to that drive for an irreducible theory of design is well documented. On the surface at least, contemporary designers were moving from authorless, scientific text — in which inviolable visual principles were carefully revealed through extensive visual research — toward a more textual position in which the designer could claim some level of ownership over the message. (This at the time literary theory was trying to move away from that very position.) But some of the basic, institutional features of design practice have a way of getting tangled up in zealous attempts at self-expression. The idea of a decentered message does not necessarily sit well in a professional relationship in which the client is paying a designer to convey specific information or emotions. In addition, most design is done in some kind of collaborative setting, either within a client relationship or in the context of a design studio that utilizes the talents of numerous creative people. Thus the origin of any particular idea is clouded. And the ever-present pressure of technology and electronic communication only further muddies the water.","Some years ago – I recall events and publications in the early 1990s – there was some noise about the ‘designer as author’: graphic designers would have a hand in writing (or maybe ‘authoring’) the texts that they also designed, and designers could even be considered as authors. It follows from the technology: the text gets shaped by designers, and the last touch before publication may now be in a designer’s hands. And there is the fact that content is always embodied in its form, and so to make form is also to shape content. But it does not follow that the designer needs to become an author. I don’t believe we should give up on the ideal of the designer working hand-in-hand with an author: listening, thinking, suggesting possibilities, making changes to rst proposals, and often following an author’s wishes. There are clear advantages in a separation of the two roles: designers see things that authors can’t, and vice versa. (Against all this, the arrival of another new technic – screen displays of content – may take this process in another direction: away from the hands of any designer and into the domain of the ‘browser’ and its settings, and of the particular screen that is used.)","If the ways a designer can be an author are myriad, complex and often confusing, the way designers have used the term and the value attributed to it are equally so. Any number of recent statements claim authorship as the panacea to the woes of the browbeaten designer. In an article in Emigre, author Anne Burdick proposed that “designers must consider themselves authors, not facilitators. This shift in perspective implies responsibility, voice, action... With voice comes a more personal connection and opportunity to explore individual options.” A recent call-for-entries for a design exhibition titled “Designer as Author: Voices and Visions” sought to identify “graphic designers who are engaged in work that transcends the traditional service-oriented commercial production, and who pursue projects that are personal, social or investigative in nature.” In the rejection of the role of the facilitator and in the call for transcendence lies the implication that authored design holds some higher, purer purpose. The amplification of the personal voice compels designers to take possession of their texts and legitimizes design as an equal of the more traditionally privileged forms of authorship."]},{"Topic":13,"Count":23,"Name":"13_archive_archiving_content_online","Representation":["archive","archiving","content","online","peer"],"Representative_Docs":["(…) Traditional archiving can be defined as the preservation for historical memory of original materials, in a condition that is as historically accurate as possible. And so Jeff Rothenberg, digital data preservation expert for Rand Corporation, may well be right when he predicts that books in the future will no longer be considered as we know them today, but rather as ‘art objects’. Small publishers tend to regard the Web as a sort of global bookshop where they (often desperately) hope to attract customers. But these publishers’ greatest asset is often their own history: their best and most successful books. Arguably their time and efforts would be better spent, not on producing unfocused blogs or unused internet forums, but on making their past treasures available and searchable online (or, at very least, a comprehensive reference to these old and out-of-print treasures: bibliographic references, cover images, tables of contents and summaries, etc). Besides increasing their own visibility (and thus attracting customers), such an archiving effort would also allow these publishers to support and preserve their own cultural context – the ‘scene’ which they previously played such an important role in describing and defining.","The Internet Archive now runs more than twenty-eight scanning centers across the globe where libraries and other institutions pay nominal fees to have their collections scanned at a rate of one thousand books per day. As of this writing, it has archived more than three million books online (that number goes up to eleven million counting e-texts). And in 2010, the Archive released over one million documents digitized in DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System), a special format that makes text accessible to readers with print disabilities, who can not only hear the text, but bookmark, search, and control its playback. Not only did the Archive prioritize not destroying the books they scanned, the process of handling so many, coupled with the constraints of copyright, led it to take the surprising step in 2011 of starting a physical archive for them. Seeing that libraries often did not want physical books returned or were storing them off-site because they were not in demand, and recognizing that holding a physical copy of each scanned book entitled the Archive to share the digital one, they initiated what Kahle called a “Physical Archive of the Internet Archive,” housed in forty-foot climate-controlled shipping containers in Richmond, California, to maintain the books, records, and movies in their digital archive.","Several important digitization initiatives followed Hart’s, born from a sense that the internet represents the future of libraries, and that digitizing text is a means of doing a public good. The Internet Archive, founded by MIT graduate Brewster Kahle in 1996 to archive the ephemeral pages of the World Wide Web, would seem to be far removed from the world of books. Best known for “The Wayback Machine,” an interface that allows visitors to see earlier versions of any website that has been indexed—like a snapshot of the site from a previous year—the Internet Archive has, over time, become a clearinghouse of media, including film, audio, text, software, and magazines, with the goal of offering permanent future access to this work in digital format. The experience of archiving the unstable and boundless Internet gave the project’s founders a fresh perspective on digitizing the book and, despite the company’s digital origins, in 2005 the Internet Archive began scanning library books for posterity. Originally a partnership with Microsoft, which provided sophisticated scanners and data storage in the first three years of the project, the Internet Archive extended its digitization tools to public and private libraries worldwide in 2008 with the intent of archiving a single scanned copy of every book ever published."]},{"Topic":14,"Count":28,"Name":"14_internet_internet technology_art_web","Representation":["internet","internet technology","art","web","appropriation"],"Representative_Docs":["All 190 works were reviewed and were categorized based on the criteria of what internet appropriation of internet technology and appropriation of web content is, (…) First it was specified what is being considered internet technology and web content between the given time frame and then it was specified what can be considered to be appropriation of internet technology and web content.

The analysis of the findings suggests that they are further areas of research for appropriating the internet, such as how appropriation in art was effected by internet technology, the conditions for appropriating web content and processes for appropriating the internet for art-making. Today, the internet is undoubtedly a defining component of cultural production and self-determination in art.

But since then, I’ve come to realize that these actions are really no different from how a collage artist would have worked in 1916, with newsprint or wallpaper. This is a taxonomy of appropriation, not web-to-print. And while that’s of interest to me in this project, the concerns with appropriation today are different — I think they have more to do with automation, copyright and privacy than cutting and pasting. So I’ve sort of dropped these rubrics, but I’m still searching for critical language that can help us understand Library of the Printed Web. Now I’m more focused on concepts that are directly relevant to this infrathin condition and to our relationship with the network specifically.","My own practice is increasingly web-to-print, so I have a special, personal interest in seeing LIBRARY OF THE PRINTED WEB evolve in real time. It’s too early to call it an anthology, but it’s more than just a casual collection of work. I’m searching for something here, a way to characterize this way of working, because these artists are not in a vacuum. They know about each other, they talk to and influence each other, and they share common connections. Each time I talk to one I get introduced to another.  Some of the links that I’ve uncovered are people like Kenneth Goldsmith, places like the Rhode Island School of Design, and certain tumblr blogs where the work is easily digested and spread, like Silvio Lorusso‘s mmmmarginalia. I’m curious—is anyone else doing this? Who is looking at web-to-print in a critical way, and who will write about it? I’d like LIBRARY OF THE PRINTED WEB to become a way for us to monitor the artist’s relationship to the screen, the database and the printed page as it evolves over time.","The strategic combination of the large amount of free content available on the Internet – popularly referred to as “big data”– and the availability of inexpensive online print-on-demand online platforms (which make it possible to cheaply print small print runs of uploaded books that can be updated at will) has favoured the emergence of a whole new generation of artists’ books. Content is harvested from the Internet and re-worked into a more-or-less classic book format. (…) Artist Paul Soulellis has described this now-classic strategy of printing data harvested form the internet as a “search, compile, publish” sequence. He refers to artistic production of this kind as the “Library of the Printed Web” and he has attempted to compile a draft taxonomy that revolves around three categories corresponding to the three main strategies: “grabbing” (and scraping), “hunting” and “performing” (…)."]},{"Topic":16,"Count":55,"Name":"16_hypertext_text_materiality_literary","Representation":["hypertext","text","materiality","literary","material"],"Representative_Docs":["As the technology changed, and especially as the Web grew in size, scope, and functionality, writers began to move away from the Storyspace interface to explore the rich diversity of interfaces available in such commercial software packages as Flash, Shockwave, and Dreamweaver and also XTML, VRML, DIRECTX, and other web-oriented languages. A new breed of SECOND-GENERATION ELECTRONIC LITERATURE began to appear that looked very different from its predecessors, experimenting with ways to incorporate narrative with sound, motion, animation, and other software functionalities. Riding on the crest of these developments, Espen Aarseth’s pioneering Cybertext: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature argued for a perspective fundamentally computational in nature. To this end he proposed the category CYBERTEXT and defined it to include a wide variety of texts that used combinatorial strategies, including print works such as Raymond Queneau’s Cent Mille Milliards, electronic fictions like Afternoon, a story, computer games, and even the I Ching. He gave substance to the idea by developing a typology of semiotic variables, including in addition to links such concepts as perspective, access, determinability, transience, dynamics, and user function. Combinations of these variables yield 576 different variations, which can be plotted on a grid to locate a particular text’s strategies within the cybertext domain. This schema is undoubtedly more appropriate to second-generation electronic literature than earlier hypertext theory, which now began to appear dated and provincial compared to Aarseth’s flexible and theoretically powerful approach. Meanwhile, other critics and writers who continue to be interested in linking have developed theoretically sophisticated ways to talk about hypertext that move considerably beyond the first generation of hypertext theorists.","My title, Writing Machines, plays with the multiple ways in which writing and materiality come together. “Writing machines” names the inscription technologies that produce literary texts, including printing presses, computers, and other devices. “Writing machines” is also what technotexts do when they bring into view the machinery that gives their verbal constructions physical reality. As a literary term, technotext can be understood through its similarities and differences to related concepts. All of the technotexts I discuss in this book could also be called hypertexts. Hypertext has at a minimum the three characteristics of MULTIPLE READING PATHS, CHUNKED TEXT, and some kind of LINKING MECHANISM to connect the chunks. The World Wide Web, with its links, millions of pages and multiple reading paths, is a vast hypertext of global proportions. From the definition, it will be immediately apparent that hypertext can be instantiated in print as well as electronic media. A print encyclopedia qualifies as a hypertext because it has multiple reading paths, a system of cross-references that serve as linking mechanisms, and chunked text in entries separated typographically from one another. These hypertextual characteristics of the encyclopedia form the basis for Milorad Pavic ́’s brilliant print work Dictionary of the Khazars: A Lexicon Novel. Other examples of print hypertexts include Ursula LeGuin’s Always Coming Home, which includes audio tapes to document a richly imagined science fiction world; Paul Zimmerman’s artist’s book High Tension, which creates a multiplicity of reading paths through an unusual physical form that allows the reader to fold diagonally cut leaves to obtain different combinations of text and image; and Robert Coover’s “The Babysitter,” a short story that pushes toward hypertext by juxtaposing contradictory and nonsequential events suggesting many simultaneously existing time lines and narrative unfoldings.","If there is a shared ground to these different disciplines and perspectives, it is that any written work is a product of the interplay between textual content (the words, concepts, rhetorical structures, literary forms, etc., that are read in the work) and medium (the affordances, qualities, and constraints of its physical materialization and structure as artifact, technology, and social and institutional form). Both content and medium are of course highly various in themselves and interlaced in complex and mutable relations of codetermination, making the broad distinction useful only as a heuristic for approaching the particular features of any given work of textual matter. Any particular material text is a multiform entity, with many different and divergent meanings, effects, and scales of operation. As Hayles argues, it is thus “impossible to specify precisely what a book—or any other text—is as a physical object” (where “physical” here denotes the material features or media forms of the work, including “the social, cultural, and technological processes that brought it into being”). Her solution to the potentially confounding effect of this field of difference is to attend to the ways that particular works themselves interrogate and mobilize their material forms and relations, a category of works she names with the term “technotext.” A technotext emerges“whenaliterary work interrogates the inscription technology that produces it.” In so far as the materiality of a work is in this way “bound up with the text’s content,” it “cannot be specified in advance” but is, rather, an “emergent” condition. A technotext, in other words, at once interrogates and produces its material form. At this point we need to bring in a third determining element to the text’s emergent materiality alongside content and medium, that of the reader, her “interactions with the work and the interpretive strategies she develops—strategies that include physical manipulations as well as conceptual framework.” Indeed, it may be the reader that makes a technotext, because a text that does not reflexively address its material forms can be made to do so by the act of reading and interpretation. So, while Hayles’s concept of technotext foregrounds works that critically reflect on their material forms, she notes that ultimately any text can be understood in these terms, given that all texts are mediated and actively consumed, whether they reflexively embody this or not."]},{"Topic":17,"Count":18,"Name":"17_nonlinear_text_nonlinearity_nonlinear text","Representation":["nonlinear","text","nonlinearity","nonlinear text","nonlinear texts"],"Representative_Docs":["There is a problem here that goes back to a flaw at the heart of my definition of nonlinear text. When I said that a text can be nonlinear by convention, the definition is laid open to interference from the interpretable level. What if a text simply insists on its nonlinearity? Should we take its word for it? There are many such texts; Milorad Pavic’s Landscape Painted with Tea (1590) comes to mind. From the second half, it can be read as a crossword puzzle, either “across” or “down,” following the explicit instructions given on pages 100-101. But what if a text gives us such instructions at the start, then cancels them later on? Or worse, what if the text starts by warning us against possible attacks of illegitimate nonlinearities, then proceeds to order us to go at once to page 50 for further instructions and skip the intervening pages that, we are told, have been contaminated by subversive directions? These hypothetical cases, which are far from impossible, illustrate a peculiar semiotic power of the linear text over the nonlinear: the linear can flirt with nonlinearity, but the nonlinear cannot lie and pretend to be linear.","The use of the term nonlinearity in this essay is grounded in mathematics and not inspired by the modern physical sciences. I emphasize this point not because I want to distance myself from the claims of literary critics, like Katherine Hayles, who employ the term in its latter sense, but because the influence of nonlinear dynamics on recent literary theory should not be confused with the present formal concept of nonlinear textuality. Insights promoted by the metaphors of nonlinear physics aid understanding of nonlinear texts as well as linear ones, but reading a nonlinear text is not the same as a reading informed by research in fractal geometry or chaos theory. The behavior of some kinds of nonlinear texts can certainly be described in terms of unpredictability, self-organization, and turbulence, but for the definition and basic understanding of nonlinear literature we need not look that far.","(…) A nonlinear text is an object of verbal communication that is not simply one fixed sequence of letters, words, and sentences but one in which the words or sequence of words may differ from reading to reading because of the shape, conventions, or mechanisms of the text. Nonlinear texts can be very different from each other, at least as different as they are from the linear texts. In the conceptual framework presented here, the linear text may be seen as a special case of the nonlinear in which the convention is to read word by word from beginning to end. Recently, because of the computer, certain types of nonlinear texts have received attention from educational, technological, and theoretical circles. Now may be the time to broaden the scope of interest and to examine textual nonlinearity from a general point of view."]},{"Topic":18,"Count":17,"Name":"18_narratives_interactive_narrative_interactive narratives","Representation":["narratives","interactive","narrative","interactive narratives","readers"],"Representative_Docs":["Conversely, when readers open most interactive narratives, they can begin making decisions about where to move and what to read right from the outset, even, as in Victory Garden, right from the text’s title. Most segments feature text that has individual words or phrases linked to other places or icons that act as navigational tools: arrows representing forward and backward movement, a feature of many hypertext narratives; (…) Unless segments are chained in a sequence with no options for navigation within each segment, readers can interrupt most interactive narratives within each segment (…) The words, paths, and actions available as “interruptions,” however, are chosen in advance by the author of the interactive narrative and not by the reader—an aspect of hypertext fiction that Espen Aarseth claims mitigates the medium’s possibilities for bona fide interactivity, classifying it, instead, (…), as “participation, play, or even use.”","More strikingly, interactive narratives have no single “ending.” Victory Garden has six different points of closure, while Michael Joyce’s afternoon has five or more—depending on the order in which the reader explores the narrative space—since the sequence in which places are read determines whether or not readers can move beyond certain decision points in the narrative. (…) Deciding when the narrative has finished becomes a function of readers deciding when they have had enough, or of understanding the story as a structure that, as Jay Bolter notes, can “embrace contradictory outcomes.” Or, as one student reader of interactive narratives realized, as he completed a series of readings of afternoon:\\r\\nWe have spent our whole lives reading stories for some kind of end, some sort of completion or goal that is reached by the characters in the story. . . . I realized this goal is not actually reached by the character, rather it is reached by our own selves. . . . [It] occurs when we have decided for ourselves that we can put down the story and be content with our interpretation of it. When we feel satisfied that we have gotten enough from the story, we are complete.","While many digital narratives begin with a scene or sequence that establishes both the identity of the user as part of an intrigue or quest and the parameters for the plot, most hypertext narratives have no single beginning. In Stuart Moulthrop’s Victory Garden, readers are confronted with, among a multitude of possible ways of entering the hypertext, three lists that seem to represent a sort of table of contents: “Places to Be,” “Paths to Explore,” and “Paths to Deplore.” Unlike a table of contents, however, these lists do not represent a hierarchical map of the narrative, providing readers with a preview of the topics they will explore during their reading and the order in which they will experience them. The first place or path in the list has no priority over any of the others—readers will not necessarily encounter it first in the course of their reading, and need not encounter it at all. Each of the words or phrases, instead, acts as a contact point for readers entering the narrative. By choosing an intriguing word or particularly interesting phrase, even constructing a sentence out of a set of choices Moulthrop supplies, readers find themselves launched on one of the many paths through the text. In print narratives, reading the table of contents—if there is one—is generally irrelevant to our experience of the narrative itself: our reading experience begins with the first words of the narrative and is completed by the last words on the last page. In Victory Garden and most hypertext fiction, however, readers have to begin making choices about their interests and the directions in which they wish to pursue them right from square I."]},{"Topic":19,"Count":23,"Name":"19_encyclopedia_knowledge_encyclopedias_britannica","Representation":["encyclopedia","knowledge","encyclopedias","britannica","world"],"Representative_Docs":["The encyclopedic impulse diminished somewhat in the age of print. As books multiplied, it became harder to aspire to the goal of a book that would encompass all important works, even in a single field. Although more encyclopedias and handbooks were produced than ever before, the aim of the encyclopedists became more utilitarian: to report more accurate information rather than to synthesize all knowledge. The French Encyclopedie, whose first volume appeared in 1751, was perhaps both the last successful encyclopedia in the medieval sense and the first modem encyclopedia, because it was a statement of the ideals of the Enlightenment as well as a compendium of technical information. In the 19th and particularly in the 20th century, making encyclopedias became a business rather than a philosophical or scholarly endeavor. Major encyclopedias now maintain permanent editorial staffs, which revise the volumes continuously to furnish up-to-date information in a convenient package. Their concern is to provide information on subjects of popular interest, not to demonstrate the interrelations of all subjects. Today, however, the ideal of the encyclopedia as a synthesis of knowledge has reemerged in a new form. Many works on CD,ROM or DVD and on the World Wide Web explicitly remediate the printed encyclopedia, while in a larger sense the millions of pages hyperlinked on the World Wide Web are being read by our culture as an electronic compendium of knowledge, both a new encyclopedia and a new library.","In spite of or indeed because of its inconsistencies, the 15th edition of the Britannica can be regarded as a forerunner of the electronically refashioned encyclopedia. The system of references in the Propaedia, which seemed irrelevant to readers of a printed book, would make more sense in an electronic edition, where the computer can facilitate the task of moving through the encyclopedic outline and among the various articles. The computer can take over the mechanical aspects of consultation: by getting the reader to the article and letting her read, by transferring her from one text to another, and by keeping her aware of her current position within the structure of the encyclopedia. In general the structure of an electronic encyclopedia can be both deeper and broader than that of its printed counterpart. If a printed book is generally divided into chapters or headings within chapters, in an electronic version the visible and useful structure may extend to the paragraph or even the sentence, and the computer can permit the reader to manipulate text at a variety of levels. In this way the computer might restore some of the legitimacy of topical arrangements for great books like the encyclopedia. At least, it answers the modern objections: that the world of textual knowledge is now too complex robe organized by topics; that any topical outline may be arbitrary or confusing; and that the reader will not be able to find topics because she will not know their place in the editor's outline. All this is true for a printed encyclopedia but not an electronic one. The problem of finding information in an electronic encyclopedia is facilitated by the fact that searching can be partly or wholly automatic, and such searching can cut across any categories established by the editor. In an electronic encyclopedia, alphabetical order is not the single canonical order of the text, as it is with a printed encyclopedia. Outlines or other topical arrangements can coexist with the alphabetical order, so that an electronic encyclopedia can be organized in as many ways as the editors and the readers can collectively imagine.","As it now moves into electronic media forms, the encyclopedic impulse is being directed in two channels. The first is the explicit remediation of the printed encyclopedia or handbook. Numerous CD-ROM and DVD products-such as  Britannica DVD 99, Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 99, Year 2000 Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia (1999), and the World Book CD Multi­ media Encyclopedia-have sought to appropriate the cultural significance of the printed encyclopedia. Many, like the Britannica DVD 99, depend on the reputation of the printed version and are excellent examples of the ways in which hypertext and hypermedia remediate print. If the  printed Britannica has the reputation of being the premier general encyclopedia in the English language, its DVD counterpart suggests that it can bring the sophistication and knowledge of the original into cyberspace. The Web page advertising the DVD proclaims: \\"Discover the world's most authoritative source of knowledge, Encyclopedia Britannica, brought to life with the world's most advanced digital technology, DVD-ROM\\" (see www.eb.com/bookstore June 22, 1999). The electronic version promises greater immediacy (it is \\"brought to life\\") through multimedia, including \\"hundreds of new videos, thousands of new images, sound files and more.\\" Immediacy of information is also guaranteed by hyperlinks among the articles and by the search capability, which allows the reader to retrieve articles that contain a key word or phrase. Finally, the topical organization of knowledge championed by Adler for the 15th edition is offered here as the \\"circle of learning\\" (a literal translation of the Greek for encyclopedia): \\"More than just another multimedia encyclopedia, Britannica DVD turns information into understanding through its unique circle of learning, so you can see how facts and ideas combine to form the big picture.\\" Encarta also remediates the printed encyclopedia, but in this case it borrows its cachet not from a venerable printed version, but from the reputation of Microsoft as a high technology computer company. It too depends on search capabilities, hyperlinks, and multi­ media to suggest that it is an improvement on printed encyclopedias. Some version of the strategy of remediation is followed by the numerous hand­ books and specialized encyclopedias also offered in CD-ROM or DVD for­ mat. Furthermore, the Britannica-like many others, including Funk and Wagnalls, Grolier, World Book, and the Columbia Encyclopedia-also exists in a Web version available by subscription. These online editions of the great book add to their claim of immediacy by connecting their user to cyberspace, which is itself already construed as a vast encyclopedia."]},{"Topic":20,"Count":71,"Name":"20_book_art_books_artists","Representation":["book","art","books","artists","artist"],"Representative_Docs":["In The Century of Artists’ Books, book artist and historian Johanna Drucker (2004) provides the basis for a critical reading of the field by analyzing a phenomenology of case studies. According to Drucker (2004, 29), “artists’ books are almost always self-conscious about the structure and meaning of the book as a form”. Artists working with books materially and conceptually reflect upon the many things a book represents: a physical object, a metaphor to organize reality (the so-called book of nature), a symbol of authoritativeness, an accessible archive, a mass-produced commodity, and so on. The form of the book — “a dynamic interface, a structured set of codes for using and accessing information and navigating the experience of a work” (Drucker 2004, VII) — is therefore present (at least as an influence or reference) in screenbased artworks and in shaping portable electronic devices, from the laptop to the e-reader.","The ubiquity of the book as a marketable artifact led Mexican author and artist Ulises Carrión (1941–1989) to write rebelliously in 1975, “A book may be the accidental container of a text, the structure of which is irrelevant to the book: these are the books of bookshops and libraries.” We have to imagine a long pause where that colon hinges the sentence together—one heavy with sarcasm. Carrión’s tongue-in-cheek dig at the book as a commercial artifact reflects on the separation of form and content he perceived in the writing and publishing of his time. Carrión was not opposed to bookshops altogether, and in fact founded one himself, Other Books and So, in Amsterdam that same year. Specializing in artists’ books and multiples, the shop was also an artist-run exhibition and event space that distributed the kind of work he wanted to see more of in the world: books conceived of as a whole, rather than “texts” bestowed by the author on a publisher for dissemination to a reading public. In an advertisement for the space, he called them “non books, anti books, pseudo books, quasi books, concrete books, visual books, conceptual books, structural books, project books, statement books, instruction books,” a list suggestive of his vexed relationship with the marketplace. Ultimately, he would coin a new term to describe the kind of artists’ publications he championed: bookworks. In part, Carrión’s was a clarion call for authors to be more attuned to the book’s materiality and impact on meaning, but it was also a demand for a breakdown of the system that privileged writing as intellectual labor and denigrated the physical aspect of book production.","Johanna Drucker, book artist and historian of artists’ books, states that «artists’ books are almost always self-conscious about the structure and meaning of the book as a form» (Drucker 2004). In this sense artists’ books are useful analytical tools of the current condition of the book as a designed artifact, as a cultural object and as a commodity. Furthermore they provide alternative reading models, often antifunctionalist, as they are «books in which the book form, a coherent sequence of pages, determines conditions of reading that are intrinsic to the work» (Carrión 1980). The proposed models, more or less viable, often represent a radicalization of the technical aspects that affect the act of reading."]},{"Topic":21,"Count":29,"Name":"21_codex_book_books_century","Representation":["codex","book","books","century","volume"],"Representative_Docs":["The Renaissance inaugurated the age of books, at least among the aristocracy, and many of the features we now associate with the codex arose in response to the boom in silent readership. Books of hours, small illuminated manuscripts commissioned by members of the laity, made worship a private act and the codex itself an object of value and status. The period saw some interesting experiments with book structure to draw attention to these precious artifacts. Girdle books, a popular form among pilgrims in the Middle Ages, continued to be made: with an oversized soft leather cover whose flaps could be looped under one’s belt for easy consultation on the go. Dos-à-dos books (sixteenth century) joined two volumes back to back, the spine of one meeting the fore-edge of the other—a useful, though rare, structure for keeping multivolume works together. And a handful of heart-shaped or cordiform books (fourteenth and fifteenth centuries)—a book of hours, a collection of ballads, and a volume of love songs—took advantage of the symmetrical opening of the codex to make the work’s form suit its content: devotion.","These ornate title pages were not, as we might expect, the first page of the books in which they appeared. That page was generally left blank to protect the contents prior to binding. In the 1600s, as codices were produced in larger quantities, printers began to include an abbreviated title on this blank sheet, inaugurating the “half title” with which we are familiar. This device arose to facilitate distribution: bookshops kept unbound books stacked in bins, so the printed title helped buyers identify the text they wanted while also preventing damage to its interior. In some cases, a volume’s owner would cut out this label and glue it inside the cover after binding, folding it over the fore-edge to help identify it on the shelf. Books were, at the time, shelved with spines facing inward, and a book’s fore-edge might be embellished with designs, gold leaf, or intricate paintings to help a reader identify it. It wasn’t until the mid-sixteenth century, as readers became collectors whose ever-expanding libraries served as displays of both intellect and wealth, that books were shelved with their spines outward to showcase their bindings, leading to the addition of authors’ names and titles to facilitate access—a feature of the codex we now take for granted.","The development of the codex corresponded to a set of new possibilities for writers and readers. In place of a script for performing the text aloud, it provided a space that was visually more sophisticated and finished. A codex could hold several times as much text as a roll. The early Christians apparently preferred this new technology, because one codex could hold all the New Testament writings. Pagan texts followed in being transferred to the new medium (see Reynolds &Wilson, 1978, pp. 30-32). The physical presence of the book also began to matter more as public performance was re, placed by individual study. Silent reading became common by the later Middle Ages, but long before that books were set before individual readers-monks in their libraries, for example (see Saenger, 1982). Writers and readers were encouraged to identify the physical book, which they held in their hands, with the text and to regard the end of the book as the end of the text. The importance of the book as an object perhaps reached its zenith in the Middle Ages, when illuminated manuscripts were examples of multimedia writing at its finest, in which all the elements functioned symbolically as well as aesthetically to define a verbal-visual meaning. In this one sense, printing was not an improvement, for it destroyed the synthesis that medieval manuscripts had achieved. On the other hand, Renaissance culture used print technology to strengthen the idea of the book as a complete and closed verbal structure. Although in medieval codices and early printed books, unrelated texts were often bound together, standardization and economies of scale eventually encouraged printers and publishers to put one text in each volume."]},{"Topic":22,"Count":46,"Name":"22_book_books_amazon_readers","Representation":["book","books","amazon","readers","text"],"Representative_Docs":["These early devices had small, low-resolution screens and rather minimal design, their flat gray cases echoing laptops and calculators of the era. There were, however, a few e-readers whose physical forms were more attuned to the reader’s hand. While they shared other early e-readers’ disregard for the typography and page design central to the development of the codex, they used their materiality to hearken back to some of its earlier affordances. In 1992, Italian architectural students Franco Crugnola and Isabella Rigamonti prototyped a floppy disc e-reader called Incipit, which emulated a scroll unrolled in both hands, its thick curved sides surrounding a screen with the dimensions of a paperback book. Buttons positioned beneath the reader’s thumbs would allow one to progress from page to page, and a keyboard at the bottom of the screen offered numeric buttons and playback keys. The NuvoMedia Rocket eBook and the SoftBook, both released in 1998 and considered the first e-readers dedicated to emulating the physical book, are notable for their handedness—each rectangular device has one thicker, rounded side that evokes the curved spine of a paperback whose front cover has been curled in the reader’s hand. The SoftBook even included a soft leather cover that turned the device on and off, boasting, “Just like a book, the SoftBook becomes ‘ready to read’ by simply opening the leather cover.” These simulations attempt to naturalize the e-reader’s single-page display—a fundamental difference from the codex’s “sequence of spaces” or openings. The design makes every page in these readers a recto (or verso, in the case of the Rocket, which adapts to either hand), awkwardly drawing attention to the interface it is trying to hide. If we were to bend back the cover of a paperback in that way, then the thick spine would pass from hand to hand as we turned the pages, or we would open the spread to read each verso before folding the cover back again.","Such scanned and digitized books, as well as the e-book editions of popular works by major publishers, are remediations of print, whose content can be accessed across multiple devices depending on their format, whether PDF, EPUB, MOBI, TXT, HTML, or Apple’s proprietary iBAC (iBooks Author). The use of the term e-book to apply to digital content read on screens blurs the boundary between content and form, much as our use of the word “book” to refer to both a specific object and a general idea allows one to be subsumed by the other. The very existence of such digital books, however, precisely because they allow content to be poured into any crystal goblet available, gave rise in the 1990s and 2000s to e-readers—dedicated devices designed specifically for book reading. Technological innovations in microprocessing, solid state drives, and E Ink have all facilitated the development of portable, handheld computers with an immense capacity for storage of not only text, but also audio, video, and, in some cases, interactive animation. Such machines had been imagined as early as Bob Brown’s readies and Vannevar Bush’s Memex, but the design of those two early projects imagines stationary devices that lack the portability for which the book was originally developed. The Amazon Kindle, launched in 2007, is one of the most popular dedicated e-readers precisely because the single, paperback-sized device, with its high-resolution E Ink screen, can store thousands of books, allowing readers to take an entire library with them on the go.","A number of e-readers appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but none really made an appreciable impact on the book market until the Kindle. This lightweight tablet, with its six-inch plain text E Ink screen framed by buttons for scrolling, page-turning, and text entry sold out within six hours of its 2007 release. “Carrying a wide range of titles sold by Amazon, the device’s chief drawback was its proprietary digital rights management system, which prevents readers from moving titles between devices. The year 2007 also saw the release of Apple’s iPhone, which introduced portable touchscreen computers to a mass market. The smartphone paved the way for the iPad two years later, which would set the standard for color tablets that double as e-readers, loading books in a variety of formats. Kindle, Kobo, Nook, and other e-book sellers in turn have issued iOS apps to keep their readers in the fold while using Apple devices, reinforcing the book as content and commodity and the reader as its consumer. The Kindle Fire (2011), with its color touchscreen, brought Amazon more directly in competition with Apple, since it allows readers access to all their Amazon content (across books, music, and video) in the cloud. The major e-readers have by now incorporated Wi-Fi, and in some cases 3G and Bluetooth to compete with the iPad."]},{"Topic":23,"Count":11,"Name":"23_smell_smells_information_hearing","Representation":["smell","smells","information","hearing","scent"],"Representative_Docs":["On a more conceptual level, the combination of smell and print has been occasionally used by artists. Rachel Morrison, senior library assistant at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, conducted a performance called Smelling the Books from 2010 to 2013, smelling and precisely catalogueing the smells of 300 out of 300,000 books in MoMA library. Her intention was to document and to foster the incredible difference in odors produced by artists’ books, but also to “foster a discussion of the future of print media.” Another relevant work is Aromapoetry by Eduardo Kac, a limited-edition book with only ten copies, in a classic A4 format with twelve “poems” made up of smells, conceptually enabling the same “interpretation” mechanism of the classic poems, as both text and smell can be interpreted in a very personal way. The poems have “distinct olfactory zones on the page” and the rhythm among the different compositions provides alternating contrasting smells. The volatility of the different aromas is compensated for by the special structure of the page provided with a “nanolayer of mesoporous glass,” which slows down the molecule release. The artist also provides the reader (collector) with vials and instructions to recharge every individual “poem.” The form of the book refers to the concept of a permanent “memory,” compared to the structural volatility of smells. Scent is conceptually closer to digital than to traditional media, being ephemeral and very hard to preserve.","To compensate for the absence of smell, there are companies trying to synthesize odors to, within a broader commercial aim, produce “expanded digital books.” Vapour Communication has built a prototype “oBook,” a “Goldilocks and the Three Bears” e-book that incorporates different synthetic smells such as flowers, berries, and hot chocolate. At certain points in the story the smells are activated through interface “scent buttons,” triggering an external device (the “oPhone”) to emit the respective scents. This “simulation” paradoxically strengthens the feeling that digital in itself is aseptic, aiming for strategies to “digitize” information, which means making it abstract and universal, inevitably losing possible variations in reader involvement. Another work remarking upon the loss of smell in the digital reading experience is the fake conceptual website pretending to sell “Smell of BooksTM” spray cans with scents like “New Book Smell” and “Classic Musty Smell” to help e-book customers feel “more comfortable with their devices.”","In comparison, classic printed publication can claim a richer sensorial environment. For one, smell is very present, indirectly giving specific information about the book, like age, paper composition, and level of preservation. The smell of printed publications varies a lot, even within the same olfactory domain: old books, for example, smell of various degrees of dust and mold, depending on their exposure to light, the types of paper and ink, the conditions of the preserving environments, and so on. New publications, like morning newspapers or just-released books or magazines, still smell of fresh ink, but each in a different way. Readers often associate the smell of some printed publications with certain content (as with newspapers), or with some places, like particular libraries or bookstores. Technically these smells are perceptible due to several hundred so-called VOCs or volatile organic compounds, which the chemical elements in a book’s paper, binding adhesives, and inks give off — in combination with the way and the place they are stored. Some scent companies have even tried to capitalize on these experiences, selling candles mimicking the smell of the New York Times or Byredo’s “Bibliothèque,” or perfumes mimicking the smell of old books, like CB’s “I Hate Perfume in the Library,” or freshly printed books, like “Paper Passion” produced by Gerhard Steidl and Wallpaper Magazine. As opposed to the previously mentioned scent-manufacturers, these commercial efforts do not intend to “compensate” for a loss, but to extract and multiply a recognizable sensorial environment, artificially recreating the experience we associate with a certain odor."]},{"Topic":24,"Count":16,"Name":"24_publishing_lippard_urgent_artistic","Representation":["publishing","lippard","urgent","artistic","artist"],"Representative_Docs":["There is some truth to this in our current reality, which complicates my simplified read of Big Tech publishing. Artists are pushing art to the masses like propaganda, alongside everyone else and their messages, (…) Lippard’s statement, and our connection to her through this fair, sets the stage for us to take the temperature today. She dreamed of a politicised, maybe radicalised, publishing future through artistic means. But publishing has always been political—artistic, academic, commercial, or otherwise. Publishing compels, persuades, informs, attracts, confuses, scripts, and manipulates. To publish is, fundamentally, a political act.","To follow this trajectory into the present moment—let’s pause and step away from our hyper-focussed view on exclusive gate-keeping institutions, such as academic and commercial publishing, art book fairs, the artist’s book, book art, and the legacy of artistic publishing in a traditional sense. I propose that we look away from the idea of ‘alternative’ art world spaces altogether, away from commercial spaces and heteronormative, market-based success, and refuse to locate the future of urgent, radical publishing in relation to these structures at all.","Artists and intellectuals despondent over the prospects for originality can take heart from a phenomenon identified about twenty years ago by Don Swanson, a library scientist at the University of Chicago. He called it “undiscovered public knowledge.” Swanson showed that standing problems in medical research may be significantly addressed, perhaps even solved, simply by systematically surveying the scientific literature. Left to its own devices, research tends to become more specialized and abstracted from the real-world problems that motivated it and to which it remains relevant. This suggests that such a problem may be tackled effectively not by commissioning more research but by assuming that most or all of the solution can already be found in various scientific journals, waiting to be assembled by someone willing to read across specialties. Swanson himself did this in the case of Raynaud’s syndrome, a disease that causes the fingers of young women to become numb. His finding is especially striking — perhaps even scandalous — because it happened in the ever-expanding biomedical sciences."]},{"Topic":25,"Count":43,"Name":"25_print_images_postprint_printed","Representation":["print","images","postprint","printed","digital"],"Representative_Docs":["Where do images fall within these design questions? Triple Canopy’s editors attest that, “One issue that came up in the transition between the two formats [the flip box and the horizontal scroll] is that you lose the impact of a photograph when it slides onto the page rather than appearing in an instant. But, we do have a full screen function for those images that require more white space around them.” Most other publications have a vertical design that introduces images as sidebars or directly aligned in the text, mainly without linking the images out or allowing for a full-screen viewing option. I would argue that this is another remnant of print culture in the digital sphere. Considering that the content of these online publications generally sways toward the theoretical more so than the glossy-print-magazine type, this brings forth a relationship with images where they are more illustrative and do not require a very specific—say, full-screen view—attention. Mousse’s Cernuschi says, “We have a complicated relationship with images because we print in a newspaper format but we’re a fine arts magazine. So we flirt with this idea of inaccurate reproduction in the first place. The priority with images is not exactly to ‘get it,’—for that, I think paper printing is a very honest filter: it looks cool, but not really good. On the screen, images look much better. I would much prefer an image printed on appropriate paper than on a screen, but that’s usually not the case. So for us it’s very different, especially considering that we can reproduce media. You develop a so-called video still aesthetic on paper.”","The critique proceeds through a rigorous examination of paratextual devices, those normally considered outside the scope of writing, but that, in fact, have everything to do with writing. Questions arise: What kind of paper did you use? Why was it on generic white computer paper when the original edition was on thick, yellowed, pulpy stock? (It was surprising to me that students had never considered this question, always defaulting to the generic computer stock at hand.) What did your choice of paper stock say about you: your aesthetic, economic, social, political, and environmental circumstances? (Students confessed that, in a world where they supposedly have more choices and freedom than ever, they tended toward the habitual. On economic and social levels, a discussion ensued about cost and availability, revealing heretofore invisible but very present class differences: some of the wealthier students were surprised to learn that other students were unable to afford a better quality of paper. Environmentally, while most claimed to be concerned about waste, none entertained the notion of electronic distribution to their classmates, defaulting instead to printing and handing out paper copies to all.) Did you reproduce exactly the original text’s layout page by page or did you simply flow the words from one page to another, the way your word processing program does? Will your text be read differently if it is in Times Roman or Verdana? (Again, most students used the word processing defaults to represent the works in digital format, using a ragged right margin—the default in Microsoft Word—even when their source text was justified. Few had thought to enter a hard page break into the word processing program correspondent to the pages they were copying from. And the same with fonts: most had never considered using anything other than Times Roman. None had considered the historical and corporate implications of font choice, how, say, Times Roman alluded to but is very different than the font that the New York Times is printed in—not to mention the waning power of the once-almighty media giant—or how Verdana, created specifically for screen readability, is a proprietary property of the Microsoft corporation. In short, every font carries a complex social, economic, and political history with it that might—if we’re attuned to it—affect the way we read a document.) In the end, we learned that writing up to that point had been a transparent experience for them, that they had never considered anything but the construction and resultant meaning of the words they were creating on the page.","Moreover, this design alludes to the phenomenon that Jessica Pressman calls the “aesthetic of bookishness.” She argues that the advent of the digital has had the paradoxical effect of stimulating widespread interest in the history of the book, with a flowering of scholarship in this area that is truly remarkable. Our collaboratively coedited essay collection Comparative Textual Media: Transforming the Humanities in the Postprint Era, which was among the first to put the term postprint into circulation, brought together some of this research to demonstrate that digitality has not endangered print books, as Jeff Gomez asserts in Print Is Dead, but rather has opened possibilities to compare different forms of textual media by engaging in what I have elsewhere called “media-specific analysis.” Here media-specific analysis takes the form of visual presentations of code along with print pages, suggesting that traditional forms of reading print may now be augmented to include reading the underlying code as well. The idea of media-specific analysis grew out of my long interest in the materiality of texts, shown perhaps most extensively in my artist’s book collaboration with designer Anne Burdick, Writing Machines. Almost a decade ago, then, I was already experimenting with the idea of “postprint,” but it has taken the intervening years for me to have the time and framework through which I could make this more than a rhetorical assertion. Now, with this book, I present a fully fleshed-out argument based on archival research, interviews, and, perhaps most importantly, an encompassing conceptual framework within which to position postprint as part of larger social, economic, and cognitive transformations. I see these transformations as analogous to other world-changing and species-defining cognitive developments such as the inventions of language and literacy. Borsuk makes much the same point when she succinctly observes, “It bears emphasizing that writing itself fundamentally changed human consciousness, much as our reliance on networked and digital devices has altered us at the core.”"]},{"Topic":26,"Count":93,"Name":"26_publishing_public_publication_urgent","Representation":["publishing","public","publication","urgent","sphere"],"Representative_Docs":["As publisher and pedagogue Eva Weinmayr indicates in the title of an instructive article, ‘One Publishes to Find Comrades’. Indeed. But the community-forming property of publishing processes and publications – their capacity to spur collaborative yet agonistic processes of negotiating, gaining critical awareness and filtering information – is not exhausted in a networking effect nor should it be underestimated as a mere instigator of communities of interest. Rather, if publishing draws on its emancipatory potential, those discursive communities – in which knowledge and action are jointly developed as a social good, and which transgress the limited scopes of traditional publishing ventures – can be used as a frame to experiment with a renewed understanding of the nature and aims of publishing. And not only this – publishing can also form spheres in which (counter-) discourse is produced and spread by (counter-)publics: within destituent publishing untertakings, those individuals or groups whose voices would otherwise be suppressed and marginalized by the existing social order, can find a shared thinking-frame, a mutual base for action, and a common voice. They may imagine, devise and performatively anticipate alternative publics and public spaces and partially also realize them. In this regard Weinmayr quotes Matthew Stadler, the founder of Publication Studio: ‘It is imperative that we publish, not only as a means to counter the influence of a hegemonic “public”, but also to reclaim the space in which we imagine ourselves and our collectivity.’ Space here can refer to both an abstract sphere and a material space.","Soullelis criticizes the often simplistic perception of publishing as an act of ‘making public’. This concept does not take into consideration that notions of public and private are increasingly vague, controversial spheres; it bluntly presumes the existence of an indisputable public, which can be addressed as a social totality. A concept of publishing framed in this manner is prone to favour a broad, nondirectional, unfiltered proliferation of information. Instead he proposes a differentiation between ‘making public’ and ‘making a public’. He explains: ‘Posting is usually “making public” but publishing is “making a public” by creating a space for the circulation of discourse.’ Whether the public is created for the circulation of discourse in order to make a publication (in this case the agents involved in the publication process are at least partially congruent with the public) or by the publication itself is irrelevant. In both cases the publication takes the role of a social or institutionalizing object instigating a ‘rhetorically active (public) sphere embedded in and constructed out of discourse’. Soullelis– calling for a critical reconsideration of the possibilities and inherent qualities of publishing – acknowledges that an audience, a public, does not exist per se but is always a ‘cultural artefact’ that must be created in a deliberate and ultimately performative act. It follows that publishing spheres as they are conceived here only exist with and for a particular audience and by their very nature have an ephemeral character. It is evident that the publication itself – conceived as a motive and programmatic device for community building and as instigator, condenser and frame for discourse – while far from being negligible, is taking on an auxiliary role. Its formal properties and shapes are, as we will read further below, defined within the process rather than ‘dictating’ its course, and can be anything from book to speech act.","A destituent publishing practice by definition remains a vague space; it produces an experience of groundlessness, which requires, in the words of Paul Benzon, a ‘tolerance for ambiguity’. Nonetheless operating on such vague terms asks for a certain framework, whose premises can be crystallized out of the work of writer and publisher Michael Bhaskar. Bhaskar in his book The Content Machine devises a conceptual framework for publishing activities. He suggests that along with the content, which is prerequisite for publishing, the activities of filtering and amplification are the constituent elements of every act of publishing. Filtering, in his conceptualization, is a collaborative process of thinking about why and when information is gathered, revealed, distributed, manipulated or suppressed. It questions the economic systems, the technological, political, and social mechanisms underlying a specific publishing undertaking, and it demands that the actors involved in a publishing process negotiate their own position and liability within these structures. Amplification, in Bhaskar’s context, is not validated by scale or by maximum reach, which are top priorities for many publishing ventures. At a conceptual extreme, as noted by Annette Gilbert in her extensive volume Publishing as Artistic Practice, if a publication at the moment of its release would only reach one figure more than those involved into the publication’s becoming, amplification has been achieved. In the activities of filtering and amplification, for Bhaskar, there is no randomness. They are not executed in a vacuum, but are conducted within frames according to models. While the frames capture the ‘presentational or performative aspect’ (they don’t just deliver the work but deliver it in a certain frame that can be anything from printed matter to speech act – and with a certain intention), the models encompass the ‘interplay of causal factors, goals, motivations and subjective ideological underpinnings that shapes and provides the raison d’ être for content’."]},{"Topic":27,"Count":13,"Name":"27_type_printing_press_morris","Representation":["type","printing","press","morris","printers"],"Representative_Docs":["(…) Finished type was sorted into tall storage cases with a cubby for each letter, mark, and space, lending the pieces the name sorts. Such cases had to be kept tidy, or a printer might find himself “out of sorts” and unable to complete a given job—an irritating situation. Typesetters, also known as compositors, worked from a manuscript, setting sorts line by line in a composing stick, a frame whose width could be adjusted depending on the desired line length. They arranged letters upside down and from right to left, with spacers between words and lines to hold them tightly in columns, creating a mirror image of the text. A completed column, known as a forme or form, was then tied with string and transferred to a galley—a metal tray—for temporary storage and proofing to ensure no words were misspelled or missing. Unlike block-books, in which the design of the page was fixed once the wood had been carved, with movable type the same set of letters could be rearranged to produce an infinite variety of texts. They could also be combined with woodblocks to print word and image simultaneously. Yet while wood carving allowed for all sorts of arrangements of words on the page, including curves and diagonal lines, hand-set type adheres to a rigid grid, making such shapes difficult to replicate.","If the trend in the age of print has been to make the visual symbol simple, unornamented, and mathematically precise, a backlash developed in the 19th century led by William Morris, who distrusted mechanization in almost any form. In England as elsewhere, 19th-century printers had been aiming for quantity rather than quality. The demand for inexpensive newspapers and books was exploding, and inventors were trying to clear the bottlenecks in production by developing mechanical printing presses, new forms of cheap paper, and mechanical typesetting. But when Morris founded the Kelmscott press in 1891, he was not interested in mass production. Instead of industrialized simplicity, he aimed for ornament and organic form, a return to the first century of printing or to age of the manuscript. He modeled his Golden Type on the work of the 15th-century printer, Nicolas Jenson. For his edition of Chaucer, he went further and designed a Neogothic typeface. He chose a hand press and handmade paper. The resulting books were beautiful, but themselves excessive, their pages dense with ink and full of ornamentation—and utterly different in spirit from the early printing that Morris meant to imitate. (See Steinberg, 1959, pp. 29–30.) The irony is that these nostalgic books could only have been produced in the Industrial Age: the precision of his Chaucer was greater than was possible in a Renaissance printed book or a medieval manuscript. It was the advance of technology that permitted Morris to go back in this characteristically Victorian way: Morris took photographic enlargements of printed pages in order to study old typefaces. (See Morris, 1982, p. xxxiv.) Morris’ work in printing was a kind of technological nostalgia that celebrated the modern technology it appeared to reject.","It is not difficult to recognize the printing press, the typewriter, and the Linotype machine as technologies. These industrial-age means of book pro­duction were complex and to a degree self-activating or self-directing. The mechanization of writing began in the 15th century with the letter press it­ self, which was the first text \\"processor,\\" the first technology of writing to duplicate words en masse. (On the development of printing, see Steinberg, 1959.) In replacing the scribe who formed letters one at a time, the press registered several pages of text onto a large sheet of paper with each impersonal pull. As McLuhan recognized in The Gutenberg Galaxy (1972), \\"the invention of typography ... provid[ed] the first uniformly repeatable commodity, the first assembly line, and the first mass-production\\" (p. 124). Printing had the additional virtue that it could produce books that were nearly identical to the best manuscripts: the press rivaled handwriting in quality while far surpassing it in quantity. Elizabeth Eisenstein (1983) noted that \\"[t]he absence of any apparent change in product was combined with a complete change in methods of production, giving rise to the paradoxical combination of seeming continuity with radical change\\" (p. 20). This para­ dox made the mechanization of the word easier to accept, and scholars in the 15th century immediately saw the advantages of this new technology. Gradually, over several generations, printing did change the visual character of the written page, making the writing space technically cleaner and clearer. The book had taken on a different and more modern look by the late 18th century. In the 19th and 20th, steam and electric presses, and automatic typesetting brought further mechanization, further distancing the human controller from the printing process and defining an industrial age of print. The computer in turn adds new flexibility to the rapidity and efficiency of printing. The computer's capacity to adjust the text to each user's needs, which is uncharacteristic of the classic industrial machine, derives from the unmechanical materials of electronic technology. The computer's central processor itself contains no gears or indeed any moving parts above the level of electrons, and even the mechanical components of a computer system, such as disk drives and printers, are characterized by rapid movement and fine control. The digital computer suggests a new definition of the machine, as a complex interrelation of logical as well as physical parts that, unlike the steam engine and the dynamo, processes information rather than producing power. If the printing press was the classic writing machine, the computer constitutes a technology of writing beyond mechanization, a postindustrial form of writing."]},{"Topic":28,"Count":39,"Name":"28_writing_computer_space_electronic","Representation":["writing","computer","space","electronic","text"],"Representative_Docs":["When in the history of writing a new technology appears, it may supplement an established technology or replace it. Papyrus was replaced in the Middle Ages by parchment and paper. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the typewriter replaced handwriting for business communications. At the same time American society was beginning to accept women into the work force so that the change created secretarial jobs for young women, who took the place of male clerks (see Zuboff, In the Age of the Smart Ma­ chine, 1988, pp. 115-116). Now the word processor has replaced the type­ writer. Whenever a dominant technology is challenged, there may be a major refashioning of the culture's writing space. The three dominant technologies since ancient times, the papyrus roll, the codex, and the printed book, each participated in the fashioning of a rather different writing space. When the codex replaced the roll, it refashioned the writing space from the still relatively oral space of ancient culture to the progressively more visual and less oral space of medieval writing. When the printed book supplanted and marginalized the codex, the writing space took on the qualities of linearity, replicability, and fixity that we have associated with the printed book. Electronic and digital technology are helping to refashion the writing space again. In the late age of print, this refashioning is not complete, and we are now experiencing the tensions and inconsistencies that come from attempts either to reconcile the two spaces of print and digital technology or definitively to replace the one with the other.","Electronic writing may also be virtual, yet all previous writing technologies were virtual as well, in the sense that they invited writers and readers to participate in an abstract space of signs. This virtual or conceptual writing space forms a continuum with the material space of writing: it is both a re­ flection of contemporary materials and techniques and an expression of our culture's ambitions for its writing. Just as new digital media refashion the material conditions of print and handwriting, so the computer's virtuality refashions the writing space of the printed book and the manuscript. The electronic writing space may seem to be severed from the material world in a way that the space of print was not. Enthusiasts for the electronic writing space often promote as revolutionary its dynamic and apparently autonomous character-the fact that Web pages and multimedia applications can act as well as react, redefining themselves in ways that neither the author nor the reader can necessarily predict in advance. Yet those actions and re­ actions are grounded in the physics and computer science of the technology and are the result of specific interventions on the part of human writers (or programmers) and readers (or users). Our literate culture is simply using the new tools provided by digital technology to reconfigure the relationship be­ tween the material practices of writing and the ideal of writing that these practices express. It remains as true for the computer as for earlier technologies that the materiality of writing \\"must be acknowledged to fully appreciate the nature of literate acts\\" (Haas, 1996, p. 3). (For a discussion of materiality and theories of language and writing in the 20th century, see Johanna Drucker's The Visible Word, 1994, particularly pp. 9-47.)","In place of the static pages of the printed book, the computer can maintain text as a dynamic network of verbal and visual elements. Although writers have been exploiting these dynamic networks for two decades, as long as we are living in the late age of print, electronic writing will seem to be in its in­fancy. The electronic incunabula include computer-controlled photocomposition, the word processor, the textual database, the electronic bulletin board and mail, and now Web sites. Word processors already demonstrate the flexibility of electronic writing in allowing writers to copy, compare, and dis­card text with the touch of a few buttons. Change is the rule in the computer, stability the exception, and, as was already realized in the 1980s, it is the rule of change that makes the word processor so useful. On the other hand, most writers have enthusiastically accepted the word processor precisely because it does not challenge their conventional notion of writing. The word processor is an aid for making perfect printed copy: the goal is still ink on paper. Like computer-controlled photocomposition, the word processor is not so much a tool for writing, as it is a tool for typography. (On the interplay between fluid­ity and fixity in word processing, see Balestri, 1988; Heim, 1987; Mullins, 1988.) The word processor treats text like a scroll, a roll of pages sewn to­gether at the ends, while its visual structures are still typographic. A conven­tional word processor does not treat the text as a network of verbal ideas. It does not contain a map of the ways in which the text may be read; it does not record or act on the semantic structure of the text. Other forms of electronic writing do all these things, making the text from the writer s point of view a network of verbal elements and from the reader s point of view a texture of possible readings. They permit the reader to share in the dynamic process of writing and to alter the voice of the text."]},{"Topic":29,"Count":33,"Name":"29_printed_paper_print_content","Representation":["printed","paper","print","content","printed page"],"Representative_Docs":["(…) The attraction of physical print may be considered an ‘instinctive’ one. The power of paper to trigger such human instincts is the focus of Pamphlet, a 2006 computer art installation by Helmut Smits consisting of a laptop, software, and a printer placed at the edge of a window. Visitors can type a message on the laptop, and by pressing ‘send’, a pamphlet is instantly printed and dropped by the printer from the 10th floor. The falling of the paper, and the resulting ‘pamphlet’ on the street, symbolise the relatively short distance between personal production and public consumption of a printed product. The installation also shows how the traditional parameters of the printed product have been disrupted: the fallen printed sheet superficially creates the same fascination as a newspaper, making it possible for someone to pick up and read something that was printed very recently. But the personal and arbitrary content of the production (and the almost instantaneous production time) give the final printed product an entirely different value.","Even worse, the industry’s best effort at coming to terms with post-digital print (print embedding some active digital qualities) is currently the QR code — those black-and-white pixelated square images which, when read with the proper mobile phone app, allow the reader access to content (usually a video or web page). This kind of technology could be used much more creatively, as a means of enriching the process of content generation. For example, since they use networks to retrieve the displayed content, printed books and magazines could include QR codes as a means of providing new updates each time they are scanned – and these updates could in turn be made printable or otherwise preservable. Digital publications might then send customised updates to personal printers, using information from different sources closely related to the publication’s content. This could potentially open up new cultural pathways and create unexpected juxtapositions (Ludovico 155).","If print increasingly becomes a valuable or collectable object, and digital publishing indeed continues to grow as expected, the two will nevertheless cross paths frequently, potentially generating new hybrid forms. Currently, the main constraint on the development of such hybrids is the publishing industry’s focus on entertainment.

Starting in the late 1980s, anyone could purchase Desktop Publishing (DTP) software in computer shops; from now on, simply owning a personal computer and a printer meant potentially having all the means of production in one’s own home. Amateurs (often referred to as the ‘bedroom generation’) could now produce printed materials in their own personal environment. At the same time, new digital storage media were being introduced, such as the floppy disk, which was cheap and compact and could carry a reasonable amount of data. (…) A number of zines started enhancing their printed editions with a floppy disk featuring ‘bonus’ content. One of the more conceptual applications was created by the Italian literary and Mail Art zine Adenoidi, adding a floppy disk containing colour pictures – which were also printed in black-and-white inside the paper zine itself, with the missing colours indicated by text captions with arrows pointing to the corresponding fields. More and more publications were designed as ‘interactive’ magazines, experimenting with various media such as the emerging CD-ROM. One trend was to reproduce as faithfully as possible the conventions and standards of print, while adding ‘bonus’ animated or audio content. (…)","From the very beginning paper publishing has been wondering about its relationship with the web. As a cover of Factsheet Five of 1995 proves, independent publishers might have been concerned with the latter before the industry. The 'yellow pages' of zines dedicated an issue to the web and its consequences for the zine world. The cover title was “Paper or Plastic?\\", and this comic perfectly synthesizes the death anxiety of the traditional zine world vis-à-vis a bold younger 'silicon' bully. Today there's no doubt that the electronic space par excellence is the web, and the whole publishing industry seems to still be wondering how to exploit this medium for their old business. Websites were created with some (or more) content taken from printed editions, and various online shops were established in order to improve sales. The latest strategy is a controversial one: giving away pdf files of glossy entertainment magazines, if you register on specialized websites. So you can find yourself not paying money, but personal data for the latest Business Week, Macworld, or Playboy issue. After registering, the download of about 50MB starts, and then you can flip or turn the pages with mouse clicks. The industry is thus dramatically improving 'distribution,' and 'readership' (two of the golden keywords of commercial publishing), apparently not affecting the magazine sales. This strategy seems to be borrowed from the p2p scheme. The better the distribution (even if for free) the better the sales.

This is a definition which can be expanded to include any of the best underground publishing productions. Yet we may ask, does it still hold true in the current digital era? What does it mean to create an ‘alternative publication’ within this new environment? The basic requirements remain the same: to challenge the prevailing medium, to formulate a new original aesthetic based on the new medium’s qualities, and to generate content which is relevant to the contemporary situation. The trailblazing ‘intermedia’ concept formulated in the mid-1960s by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins seems to have now become the norm; and while independent publishers in the 21st century are increasingly apprehensive about their future survival, they will certainly use offset printing, photocopies, print on demand, PDF files, blogs, or whatever combination of media happens to be most useful for their current project."]},{"Topic":31,"Count":50,"Name":"31_digital_post_post digital_media","Representation":["digital","post","post digital","media","technology"],"Representative_Docs":["I take up some of these themes of hybrid and unbound publishing with regard to magazine form in chapter 5, but this book is more strongly informed by a different aspect of the post-digital. Here the post-digital signifies a critical distance to digital media and its commercially induced pull of the “new,” what Lorusso calls “an obsessive quest for future models,” where the space that experimentation and innovation is sought “frequently corresponds to the narrow ecosystem of the newest device or platform.” In this sense, with Cramer again, “the term ‘post-digital’ can be used to describe either a contemporary disenchantment with digital information systems and media gadgets, or a period in which our fascination with these systems and gadgets has become historical.” Regarding the presence of print in post-digital publishing, it is not, for example, a revival of mimeographed zines but “zines that become anti-blogs,” even as zines are at the same time transformed by the ethical and organizational conventions of online and open source cultures. This is a feature of the considerable interest in print publications that has accompanied the expansion of digital media, where the post-digital is characterized by an experimental focus on the materialities, aesthetics, and properties of printed media. There is a historical dimension to it, apparent in high-profile exhibitions in London, for example, on the dissident Surrealist journal Documents at the Hayward Gallery in 2006 (where the journal took center stage rather than the movement), Futurist and avant-garde books at the British Library in 2007–8, and bookworks at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2008. This historical focus might have suggested a last gasp of interest in print publishing, its specific qualities becoming visible at the moment of its demise, had it not been accompanied by a burgeoning practitioner field of small-scale print publishing—in art and critical theory circles but also in more overtly political scenes.

Magazine (2012–), which has the rare distinction of being the last paper newspaper in Fleet Street, London’s traditional home of the print industry; LIES: A Journal of Materialist Feminism, a queer and antiracist project framed compellingly as “a communist journal against communists”; Letters: An Anti-Political Communist Journal (2007–), experimental in both content and form; Chto Delat? (2003–), newspaper of the Russian art and activism group of the same name; and Tiempo Muerto (2012–), an anarchist arts and letters newspaper from Mexico City. This realm of print publishing is also sustained by a wealth of small press and self-publishers’ fairs and centers. To name a handful of these with which I am familiar, London’s Publish and Be Damned, DIY Cultures, Small Publishers Fair, London Art Book Fair, the London Anarchist Bookfair, New York’s NY Art Book Fair, and bookwork centers like Minnesota’s Open Book; New York’s Printed Matter and Franklin Furnace; and London’s bookartbookshop, Book Works, London Centre for Book Arts, and Banner Repeater. In the post-digital manner that I have been describing, such contemporary print projects tend to be highly attentive to the particular aesthetics and social relations of printed matter, holding a critical and reflexive distance from digital and online media, while also utilizing digital capacities. For instance, while the Chto Delat? group publish online, they see the organizational, social, and sensory qualities and effects of the printed newspaper—a Russian and English bilingual publication in print runs of one thousand to nine thousand, distributed for free at exhibitions and political events—as a key dimension of their practice. Or take the small press AND Publishing (2009–), which focuses on the aesthetic and political capacities of the print technology of print on demand, whose digital capacities enable the publication of printed artists’ books “without having to compromise and conform [to] the conventions of a mass market.” And a number of small press publishers employ open source business models where books are simultaneously available as purchasable hard copy and free downloadable e-pubs, as is the case with Open Humanities Press, Punctum Books, re.press, Minor Compositions, and Open Book Publishers.","The term “post-digital” was coined by composer Kim Cascone in his essay “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music”. According to Cascone (2000, 393), “the revolutionary period of the digital information age has surely passed. The tendrils of digital technology have in some way touched everyone.” His main reference was Nicholas Negroponte (1998), who stated that “the digital revolution is over [and soon] like air and drinking water, being digital will be noticed only by its absence, not its presence.” Both Negroponte and Cascone recognized the fact that, at least in the first world, digital technology is an integral part of our everyday life and it is consequently taken for granted. In this sense the very attribute ‘digital’ becomes meaningless, as almost every artifact we currently deal with is produced, distributed, mediated, or at least affected by digital means. Cascone’s (2000, 394) notion of post-digital was tightly bound to ‘glitch’ movement, an aesthetics rooted in a practice that goes “beyond the boundary of ‘normal’ functions and uses of software”, through “experimentation rather than empirical investigation”.","The term “post-digital” was coined by composer Kim Cascone in his essay “The Aesthetics of Failure: ‘Post-digital’ Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music”.
